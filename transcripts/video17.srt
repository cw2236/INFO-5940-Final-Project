1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
And finally, just practically speaking,

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,580
you're not gonna lose your TikTok.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,500
A ban is terrible use of words.

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,540
They're saying if you don't sell this thing,

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:11,680
we're gonna ban it.

6
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,040
They will sell it,

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,400
because there's too much money involved.

8
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,360
The reason TikTok in the secondary market

9
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,640
is trading at a $250 billion value on secondary markets,

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,920
for secondary shares,

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,040
is because of this overhang around US political tensions.

12
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,040
Their biggest investors are in China and in the US,

13
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,120
and they're capitalists.

14
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,560
General Atlantic partners, Sequoia,

15
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,620
some very big hedge funds and investors in China.

16
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:40,240
They're not gonna let that $250 billion be wiped out.

17
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,880
When the threat is credible,

18
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,360
this bill passes,

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,440
within a few weeks,

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,040
ByteDance announces they are selling to Western interests,

21
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,000
they get to keep their money,

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,440
and you still get your TikTok.

23
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,040
This isn't a ban.

24
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,760
This is saying we need the ownership structure

25
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,280
to change for defense reasons.

26
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,560
I think it's gonna happen.
