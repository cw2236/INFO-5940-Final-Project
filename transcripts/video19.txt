 One thing that's overhyped, I love talking about overhyped technology, on this stage I said 3D printing, wearables, VR were all overhyped. I think the new big overhyped one is self-driving. I don't think, according to Elon Musk, three years ago or two and a half years ago, within a year there were going to be a million self-driving Teslas on the road. Business Insider said there would be 10 million. And so far there's 1,400.
