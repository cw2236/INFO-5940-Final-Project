00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I think we're going to see a narrative and some evidence that these GLP-1 drugs that reduce your cravings,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
the people on these drugs are actually consuming less social media.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
There is a cohort of people that are on social media 24 by 7.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And whether it's porn, whether it's Instagram, whether it's TikTok or Twitter,

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
it is an addiction and that is it gets in the way of the rest of your life.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And I think we're going to find that people on these drugs reduce their social media consumption, among other addictions.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And I wonder how the market is going to react to that.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So I think that's coming. I think we're going to start to see news.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
In addition to reducing your nail biting, your alcohol consumption, your consumption of Pringles,

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
you're also less likely to be on Instagram 14 hours a day.
