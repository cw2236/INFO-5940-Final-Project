 I think Twitter is sort of the pre-shock to the earthquake, and that is I think this virus of reckless behavior has jumped or escaped the lab of Twitter and is now infecting Tesla. Tesla's brand equity has declined dramatically. And when you look at that coupled with dramatic new entrants in the EV space, I think you could see Tesla shed the equivalent of seven Twitters. I think Tesla could go from $600 billion to $300 billion very easily with this decline in brand equity. So I think the real story here is the decline in Tesla's value because of Elon's activities at Twitter.
