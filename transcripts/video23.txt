 You have predicted that Biden will be re-elected and Trump will go to jail in 2024. How short can you be? Why are you saying that? Well, I don't think you can be sure. If you look at the jurisdictions he's been charged in, they have between a 70% and 92% conviction rate, and only a third of people who receive the indictments or the charges that he's received don't end up with prison time. So even if you were to discount those statistics or cut them in half, because it is a different situation, it just seems mathematically improbable that he won't be sentenced to prison at some point. So it's become a bit of a game show, and that is his objective is to slow down the trials until after. But if you look at statistically the likelihood that one of these 93 charges will stick, it just feels mathematically likely something is going to stick here. So they say 91, but nonetheless, we're just nitpicking here. Thank you. And you think these trials, at least one of them, will come to fruition and sentencing before the election? I think we'll find out in the next couple of months.
