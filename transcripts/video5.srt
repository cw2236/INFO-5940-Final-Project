1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's 1800 hours Eastern Standard Time.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Welcome.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,360
My name is Scott Galloway, Professor of Marketing at NYU Stern and the founder of Section 4,

4
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,700
and we appreciate your time tonight.

5
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,800
Over the course of the next 40 to 50 minutes, we're going to be talking about our predictions

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,140
for 2021.

7
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,820
Some disclosure right up front.

8
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,540
I get this wrong all the time.

9
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:43,780
And as Eisenhower said, plans are useless, but planning is invaluable.

10
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,940
And I think the same about predictions.

11
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,620
Predictions are somewhat worthless, but predicting is invaluable, as hopefully this catalyzes

12
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:55,780
some discussion within your own organization that helps you develop economic security for

13
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,660
you and your family.

14
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,940
So with that, we're going to revisit our predictions from 2020, keep a scorecard, try and hold

15
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:02,940
ourselves accountable.

16
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,260
Then we're going to bust into our predictions for the next 12 months.

17
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,260
We'll do a summary.

18
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,000
We'll open it up to Q&A.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,460
And then we're going to close on some thoughts on prosperity versus progress.

20
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:18,540
Quick add, the firm I work for, Section 4, launches Sprints.

21
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:25,380
In sum, our objective is to offer elite marketing and strategy business school electives at

22
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,860
one tenth the price.

23
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,700
Every course we have offered has sold out.

24
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,340
Our latest course, Product Strategy, with Professor Adam Alter, a colleague of mine

25
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,180
at NYU Stern, kicks off in January, is sold out.

26
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:41,260
I will then be teaching the next two sprints, Brand kicking off in February and Strategy

27
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,380
kicking off in March.

28
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:49,020
And then also in March, we'll have Platform Strategy with Kellogg Professor of Strategy

29
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,540
and Marketing, Mohan Saini, kicking off in March.

30
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,740
Again, every one of our courses has sold out.

31
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,860
If you cannot afford the fee, please reach out.

32
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:02,340
And we give away approximately 10% of all enrollments are for scholarships.

33
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:08,380
Okay, if you want to ask a question towards the end of this session, please upvote your

34
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,780
favorite questions, submit a question on the Q&A panel, and then for a greater chance of

35
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,340
getting it answered, we'll pick the ones that are upvoted.

36
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:19,340
We'll put you on our virtual stage and you will get the opportunity to ask a question.

37
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,340
What is real?

38
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,500
What is real?

39
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,460
Some disclosures.

40
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:28,380
I have purchased stock in this year or own stock in the following companies.

41
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,860
Some of them are private, some of them are public.

42
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,860
So if I sound like I'm talking my own book, I am.

43
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,740
But I'd like to think I'm putting my money where my mouth is.

44
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:41,500
And I'm not just saying this, I'm actually I have some, if you will, some skin in the

45
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,500
game.

46
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,860
So let's revisit 2020.

47
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,580
Prediction, the Democratic nominee would be Bloomberg or Buttigieg.

48
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,580
Got that wrong.

49
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,580
Enough said.

50
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,500
I know that's you.

51
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,540
But I'm going to miss the I had not seen the background.

52
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,220
This is quite nice.

53
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:03,020
I'm going to miss the misogyny, the bigotry and the general ass or head up your assery

54
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,660
stupidity of the last four years.

55
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,740
I'm going to miss that.

56
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,500
But anyways, welcome Biden and Harris.

57
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,420
Uber exits food delivery.

58
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,940
We got that wrong.

59
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,940
We got that wrong.

60
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:16,780
As a matter of fact, they doubled down on food delivery, acquired Postmates.

61
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,020
And this, to be fair, I'm not a big fan of Uber.

62
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,500
I think it's part of the menace economy.

63
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:26,940
We figured out a way to take advantage of a permanent underclass new software to circumvent

64
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,940
minimum wage laws.

65
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:32,900
But distinct to that, you have to give the management team kudos for pivoting and taking

66
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:38,300
advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic and moving into food delivery, which has surged as ride

67
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,140
hailing has declined.

68
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:44,020
And you can see that this probably saved Uber's market capitalization.

69
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,020
You got to think that Uber would be struggling right now.

70
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,620
Have they not made this acquisition?

71
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:52,940
For 24 months, FedEx is acquired or down 30% as a prediction I made.

72
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:58,700
Amazon is now spending more money on fulfillment than FedEx or Walmart and has a clean sheet

73
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,220
design and it's just executing better.

74
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,980
And I thought this was going to primarily be the beginning of the end for FedEx.

75
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,740
And I thought this was going really well.

76
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:11,620
And then COVID came along and distinct of all the death, disease and disability, it's

77
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,900
messed with my predictions, which is really the tragedy here.

78
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,180
And as you can tell, FedEx has surged.

79
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,260
Good for them.

80
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,540
Their shipping volumes are up.

81
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,900
They're going to play a critical role in the distribution of the vaccine.

82
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,900
Way to go, guys.

83
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:28,180
Amazon will be the fastest growing health care company in the world by 2025.

84
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:32,260
I'm going to say that we have gotten this right or we are getting it right.

85
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:38,220
Amazon has piloted several health care initiatives on its own employees and has all the assets

86
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:45,140
to create a corpus of your digital health care system, specifically a wearable that

87
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:49,620
tracks a lot of data, including your body mass index, your movement, what foods you

88
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,620
order, your purchase history, your demographics, your wealth, whether you're in a monogamous

89
00:04:54,620 --> 00:05:00,420
relationship, your zip code, all the actuarial inputs you would need to build an entire vision

90
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,180
or image of your digital health.

91
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,940
And they'll be able to not only offer you products and services and a diet, but get

92
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,420
off their heels and onto their toes from a health care standpoint and perhaps offer

93
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:14,820
you insurance, diagnostics or even primary care over smartphones or smart speakers.

94
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,220
I believe that the relationship Amazon has with 82 percent of American households, and

95
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,660
by the way, that's the most trusted relationship in the United States between a corporation

96
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,460
and a company, that health care is a natural fit.

97
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:30,180
And it is clear they are lining up their tanks, their planes and their artillery at the border

98
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:35,740
to go after what is the most disruptible business in the world, specifically the 17 percent

99
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:41,420
of US GDP or the four, the three to four trillion dollar business that is health care.

100
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,500
The party stops in 2020.

101
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,780
We predicted this in December after basically an 11 year bull run and we see a 20 percent

102
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,300
correction in the Dow.

103
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,780
Boom, that happened.

104
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,220
It's also had a vicious rip back, but we did have that decline.

105
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,660
I'm going to give us a win there.

106
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,460
Private company valuations will continue to decline.

107
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,460
We're seeing declines.

108
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:04,000
There are some big winners, but on the whole, there have been more down rounds, approximately

109
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,160
double the number of down rounds in 2020 than there had been in previous years.

110
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,600
Vision Fund 2 does not happen.

111
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,080
Remember WeWork, doesn't that just seem cute now?

112
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,560
Doesn't that just seem kind of fun, the whole SoftBank WeWork fiasco?

113
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,960
Well, we were right here.

114
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,560
This thing has not worked from the start.

115
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:27,400
Take somebody who conflates the luckiest investment in the world, 10 million, 50 million into

116
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,160
Alibaba for a hundred million dollar return and they start believing they're a genius

117
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,480
and regression of the mean and karma has a way of catching up to you and Vision Fund

118
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,640
2 is not going to happen.

119
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,680
In 2020, Airbnb becomes more valuable than Uber.

120
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,840
You might say, well, that's obvious.

121
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,480
Well, it wasn't obvious at the time when we made the prediction, when we made the prediction,

122
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,280
Airbnb's value was 30 billion and went to 18.

123
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,600
And at the same time, Uber's valuation was approximately double.

124
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,320
So we said, OK, these things are going to revert.

125
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,280
Where are we now?

126
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,760
They're primarily equal.

127
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,400
And that is because of the pandemic, because of a great move around acquiring a ride

128
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,120
hailing, excuse me, a delivery company, Uber stock has surged, but it hasn't surged as

129
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:12,000
much as Airbnb and Airbnb is on the precipice of eclipsing Uber's market capitalization.

130
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,240
As a matter of fact, it may have happened today.

131
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,080
Why is Airbnb such an incredible gangster company?

132
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,240
It is a platform.

133
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,520
It has incredible moats around network effects.

134
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:28,080
And as we're seeing, it is accelerating 115% up on the first day of the IPO.

135
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,280
Twitter attracts an activist investor or is acquired.

136
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,920
I wrote a letter to the board of Twitter management or to the board of directors.

137
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,480
Interesting, I did not hear back.

138
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,880
They did not write the dog back.

139
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:48,560
And to be blunt, I felt that Twitter having a part time CEO is on the verge of comical.

140
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,320
I've been on several public company boards and dozens of private boards, and I've never

141
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,160
met a CEO who can manage two firms at the same time.

142
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,400
So maybe Dorsey has some superpower I'm not aware of.

143
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,960
And if Twitter moves just one, three, 10% of its revenue to a subscription model, I

144
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,160
believe that the stock would surge.

145
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,760
And as a result, Elliot, one of the largest hedge funds in the world, read my letter and

146
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:15,440
basically showed up and signed it with a $1 billion pen, got three seats on the board,

147
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,000
which means that the board knew that they were outgunned and they gave up board seats

148
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,400
incredibly, incredibly fast.

149
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:27,640
The stock has continued to go up and I believe that the stock will hit $70 per share if the

150
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:32,360
board continues to pull its head out of its ass and fires the part time CEO, moves him

151
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,200
up to chairman so he can have peace with dignity and shows any pulse around subscription.

152
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,640
I think that's going to happen this year.

153
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,960
By the way, management teams and boards don't put out letters confirming or validating or

154
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,320
reinforcing the CEO's job unless they're about to fire him and he's looking for peace with

155
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,580
honor or a graceful exit.

156
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,740
We have here an absentee CEO.

157
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:58,340
This is a number of words spoken in the earnings call by the Twitter CEO versus the other CEOs.

158
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,340
Now is he just an introvert?

159
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,660
Earnings calls aren't silent retreats.

160
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:06,700
This is an opportunity for you to outline your vision and he has no vision because in

161
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:11,060
the afternoon he is at another company that represents 90% of his wealth.

162
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,980
What do we also have here with our part time CEO?

163
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,660
We have part time revenue growth.

164
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,300
Look at the usage patterns there up.

165
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,340
To be clear, this is a fantastic product.

166
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:24,340
Yet, yet the revenue growth does not match their user growth.

167
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:29,500
Whereas at the other social media firms, Snap and Facebook, revenue growth is outpacing

168
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,660
user growth.

169
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,820
What is wrong with this movie?

170
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,780
When Dorsey speaks, the stock drops.

171
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:44,140
This guy opens his mouth and people say, wow, great product, great opportunity, shitty part

172
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:49,260
time CEO and every time he speaks, he reinforces our instincts here.

173
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,780
Let's sell the stock.

174
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:55,780
Quibi will be the worst performing unicorn in 2020.

175
00:09:55,780 --> 00:10:00,060
And the tough thing about predictions is when you get them right, they seem obvious in retrospect.

176
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:05,620
But a little a little 411 on when we made this prediction, we made it a long time ago

177
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,580
before they even launched.

178
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,780
As a matter of fact, the CFO of the company was a Stern grad called me and said, hey,

179
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,900
boss, can you not dance on our grave before we've been birded?

180
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,620
You're not helping.

181
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,460
So I quieted the hell down.

182
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,580
But not after I said this thing made absolutely no sense.

183
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,940
And look at the headlines and the excitement coming out of the gates for Quibi.

184
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,340
Oh, my God, quick bites.

185
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,300
It's going to be awesome.

186
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,100
Right. They secured 100 million dollars of ad commitments ahead of launch.

187
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,900
Remember all the excitement about the new judge, Judy.

188
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:35,620
Right. I wrote this post in February saying this thing made absolutely no sense.

189
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,300
And what skill, what vision did we bring to the party here?

190
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:45,460
Math simply put for every billion dollars in content that you get from Apple,

191
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,300
they only charge you 83 cents a month.

192
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,980
Netflix gives you a billion dollars in content in exchange for 81 cents a month.

193
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,140
And guess what?

194
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:57,900
Quibi thought by slicing stuff up into three or five or seven minute segments

195
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,180
that they could charge you eight bucks for every billion dollars in content.

196
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,220
That just made no sense.

197
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,540
They showed up to a squirt.

198
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,300
They showed up to a howitzer fight with a squirt gun.

199
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,540
This thing just right out of the gates was a terrible value proposition.

200
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,620
They were outgunned.

201
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,060
What do you know? What do you know?

202
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,260
Just after six months.

203
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:17,820
By the way, if you're working at Quibi, the best thing that can happen to you is success.

204
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,860
The second best thing that can happen is quick failure.

205
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:25,220
So the second best thing happened to the folks at Quibi and the people who work there.

206
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:30,780
Whereas failing over decades or a decade, like I did a red envelope, that shit hurts.

207
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,180
That shit hurts. So failing fast.

208
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,260
Don't feel sorry for them. They are just fine.

209
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:38,740
Apple goes full Rundle and hits 200 bucks a share.

210
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,340
That's the prediction here.

211
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,900
That's the prediction. Why? Why?

212
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:47,060
Because we predicted they would go full Rundle back in October.

213
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:50,540
What I believe will be one of the most powerful recurring revenue bundles,

214
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,700
and that is the Apple Rundle.

215
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,820
This bundle of goods will likely include Apple TV Plus and Apple Music, which is gangster.

216
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,700
But in my view, in my view, they should go they should go big time

217
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,900
and include Arcade, Apple News Plus and Apple Care Plus.

218
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:10,140
Don't you love listening to me as you're watching me?

219
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:14,780
That's like shavings of shit on a shit salad. Sorry about that.

220
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:18,020
Expect more. Anyways, look what's happening here.

221
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,460
Look what's happening.

222
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:22,940
Apple has had anemic growth both on the top line and the bottom line,

223
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,580
yet its stock price has accelerated. Why?

224
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:29,340
Why? Excuse me for my Senator Rubio, our senior senator,

225
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:34,060
whose testicles have not descended yet and has shown an extraordinary lack of leadership,

226
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,700
an extraordinary lack of leadership.

227
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,300
Anyways, here's to you, Senator Rubio.

228
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:44,100
That's good Italian overpriced ecologically or environmentally unfriendly water.

229
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,180
OK, OK.

230
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:50,300
So how is our stock price increased three and a half fold on a mild increase

231
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,820
in top line revenue and bottom line revenue?

232
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,580
Simple. A move to a recurring revenue bundle that got from nine percent recurring revenue

233
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,020
five years ago to almost 24 percent.

234
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,620
My guess is they like when they get their lips around the crack pipe

235
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:06,100
of shareholder growth at the hands of the most accretive action in business history.

236
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:11,620
Moving to a recurring revenue bundle, as we call it, as we call it, the rundle.

237
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:16,700
When they go full rundle, this is the most accretive action in business history.

238
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,180
And you need to be a CEO who not only thinks about top line and bottom line,

239
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,780
but your business model and moving into a monogamous relationship with your

240
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:30,100
consumer set. Apple took 42 years, 42 years to get to a trillion dollars.

241
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:34,060
And then it took five months to get to two trillion on the back of a recurring revenue

242
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:39,580
bundle. Apple is going full rundle in 2021.

243
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,620
What does that mean?

244
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:44,260
They're going to take their B League, Joey Bagadonis, Bad News Bears

245
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,300
existing rundle, right there, Apple won.

246
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,460
And they're going to add in this and they're going to add in the watch

247
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,180
and they're going to add in the AirPod Pros and they're going to add in the iPad.

248
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,180
You know, the ship we love Apple for.

249
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,900
And they will say to the billion wealthiest people on the planet,

250
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:03,020
iOS users, if you come in with us, if you establish a monogamous relationship

251
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:07,300
at 50, 100, 200 bucks a month, you get all of this early.

252
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,620
You get it preloaded.

253
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,620
The biggest mistake, the biggest mistake we make as marketers

254
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:16,700
and Apple has realized this, who's probably the best marketer in the world,

255
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,500
is that choice is not a good thing.

256
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,340
Choice is a bad thing. Choice is a tax. What do we want?

257
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,580
We don't want more choice. We want fewer choices.

258
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,220
We just want to be more confident.

259
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,300
And the choice is presented.

260
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:31,500
They just peel off 10 percent of the people signaling, have sex with me.

261
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,540
I'm a better storyteller. I'm a baller. I make money.

262
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,540
You should have kids with me.

263
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:39,100
Your kids are more likely to survive if you have sex with me and we procreate

264
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,420
than if you have sex with someone who has an Android device.

265
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,020
True story, true story.

266
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,580
So if they just get 10 percent of their iOS base, that's 100 million people

267
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,700
and 100 bucks a month, they have 10 billion dollars a month in recurring revenue.

268
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,300
Boom, 200 dollars a share.

269
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,660
Boom, three trillion dollar market capitalization.

270
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,780
It's coming. Our prediction.

271
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:01,100
We said that Disney would win round one of the streaming wars.

272
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,260
And you say, well, that's obvious.

273
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,580
Well, it was an obvious back when we said that.

274
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,700
This is where Disney was. The Disney Channel had not worked.

275
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,700
People had a head start on them. People had more capital.

276
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,820
This is where we were when we made this prediction.

277
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,580
And then what happened a year later?

278
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,020
Disney has absolutely sprinted out.

279
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:21,780
We're talking like steroid Ben Johnson out of the blocks here.

280
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:27,180
It has been inspiring both on an Emmy side and on a new subscriber side.

281
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,500
We also predicted.

282
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,140
That Shopify and Roku would be the new kids on the block,

283
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,860
that these companies were coming into their own

284
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,540
and would achieve an altitude or an elevation they hadn't done yet.

285
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,620
And oh, my gosh, look at these two.

286
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,460
Look at these two. We're so proud. We're so proud.

287
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,180
Canada. Oh, my gosh.

288
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,100
It's good to see Canada.

289
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,820
Can you imagine that Canada right now says, are we in an apartment

290
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,220
living above a meth lab called America?

291
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,740
Anyway, anyway, different talk show of one hundred and sixty and one hundred

292
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,460
and ninety five percent.

293
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,820
Shopify now worth more than FedEx, the largest mall operator, Simon

294
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:05,700
and Nordstrom. And look at these metrics around Roku.

295
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,660
Oh, my gosh, Roku.

296
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,540
I don't really know what Roku does.

297
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,620
I just know that they are killing it.

298
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,860
We said that TikTok and Microsoft was a total head fake.

299
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,260
And there was no way this would happen. Why?

300
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:20,100
Because distinctive what the current administration would like to believe,

301
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,620
we are a nation of laws.

302
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,300
We're also a nation of immigrants.

303
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:27,500
Anyways, 50 percent of PhDs in the US immigrants.

304
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,980
Hello. Hello.

305
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,780
70 percent of the NASDAQ by dollar volume run by first

306
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,300
and second generation immigrant.

307
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,060
I know. I know.

308
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:38,740
Our team gets the first round draft choice from every team in the nation.

309
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,340
But we don't want that.

310
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:44,180
We want to be xenophobes and really fucking weird and say to everyone,

311
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,020
no, we don't want the best people in the world.

312
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,620
We're going to be strange bigots.

313
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,660
Well, guess what?

314
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,380
We're a nation of laws and distinctive.

315
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,700
The current administration deciding to slice up and fork up

316
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:57,580
the corporate world, distinctive Microsoft going for this bait.

317
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,180
What idiots? Did you really think this was going to happen?

318
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,500
Did you really think this was going to happen?

319
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,820
We predicted it wouldn't. And we were right.

320
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:08,260
This made absolutely no sense whatsoever.

321
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,540
Oracle didn't win either.

322
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,420
They've just become a minority investor. Why?

323
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,180
Because she's in charge here.

324
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:18,580
China co-ops is an autocracy and has control over all of these firms.

325
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:21,460
By the way, TikTok is in fact a security risk.

326
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,900
And there is no reason that these firms, Chinese firms,

327
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,740
should have unfettered access to our markets if we don't have access to theirs.

328
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,300
But unilateralist, stupid, 140 character decisions were not sustainable.

329
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,420
Let's talk about this year.

330
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,660
Let's talk about 2021.

331
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,780
OK, first prediction in the face of antitrust,

332
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,140
Facebook stock increases and Amazon spins.

333
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:47,780
Have you noticed the distinct of this horrible crime against humanity

334
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:52,020
that the FTC actually wants to break up Facebook, as does any other

335
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,940
lawmaker that sees their eyes on the on the governor's mansion

336
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,340
who's an AG right now.

337
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,420
And what do you know? Facebook stock didn't move.

338
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,140
As a matter of fact, we've known this is coming for about three months.

339
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,020
And Facebook stock continues to accelerate.

340
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:08,620
In addition, there are now two points on the line of antitrust.

341
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:12,500
Two points. The first was the DOJ's action against Google.

342
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,180
The second was the FTC and the AG's against Facebook.

343
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,500
Who's third? Who's third?

344
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,380
It's going to be that company in Seattle.

345
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:23,700
But Bezos is smarter and probably more ego driven than any of the rest of us.

346
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,820
Why? Because he's my agent.

347
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,060
He's having the mother of all midlife crises.

348
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:31,220
By the way, I can relate to this because I'm in the midst of a midlife crisis.

349
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,220
That's the bad news.

350
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:36,060
The good news is I believe I'm going to grow out of it in about 40 or 50 years.

351
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:40,260
Anyways, anyways, there's no one who's going to tell Bezos to break up.

352
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,660
So he's going to say, no, I'm breaking up with you.

353
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:47,860
And he's going to spend AWS and AWS will be the most valuable company by 2025.

354
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,020
By using its vast rows of data and money,

355
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,940
Facebook has squashed or hindered what the company perceived to be potential threats.

356
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,820
The bottom line is they have shown up and said join or die.

357
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:01,300
But more than that, more than that, what what what could have what's happening?

358
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,940
That's the problem with innovation suppression.

359
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:07,460
When antitrust, when the DOJ has been asleep for 20 years,

360
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,380
we don't know what could have happened with WhatsApp.

361
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:14,140
I believe that WhatsApp might have gone into video or collaboration.

362
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:18,820
You think WhatsApp would have sat by and let teams or let Slack or let Zoom

363
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,940
developed into the companies they are.

364
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,220
I believe WhatsApp would be worth more right now and will be worth more

365
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,660
when it's an independent company.

366
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:31,180
But however, the sociopath and his lipstick on cancer

367
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,340
are lining troops up at the border.

368
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:38,020
Almost a third of lawyers at Facebook have been hired in the last 24 months.

369
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,460
He is not going to go down without a fight.

370
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,780
But oh, my brothers, he is going to go down.

371
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:46,500
And my sisters, the whole is less than the sum of its parts here.

372
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,020
As a split up firm similar to John D.

373
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:53,420
Rockefeller Rockefeller, when they took Standard Oil and split it into 34 companies,

374
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,220
Mark Zuckerberg will get wealthy here.

375
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,900
As a matter of fact, every stakeholder benefits in a breakup.

376
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:04,380
Shareholders, the tax base, VC backed companies, the employees who have more options.

377
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,380
Competition is a wonderful thing.

378
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:10,260
The only the only person who doesn't win is the CEO who wants to sit on the iron

379
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,980
throne of all seven realms, not just be king of the north.

380
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,580
Break this shit up.

381
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:20,220
AWS, the most valuable company in the world that is spun prophylactically by Bezos.

382
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,780
The great dispersion. Big theme here.

383
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:26,260
Big theme here. We've been talking about COVID-19 be more of an accelerant

384
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,100
than a change agent.

385
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,620
What is the real trend here, though? It's dispersion.

386
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,700
And that is value.

387
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,780
The core value a company offers is being dispersed to the end consumer

388
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:40,700
and skipping the traditional channels of distribution, be they stores,

389
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,100
be they movie theaters, be they traditional sales channels.

390
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,540
And I think this is arguably the biggest trend in business

391
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,900
and will create the most shareholder value.

392
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:53,260
We've had globalization, we've had digitization, and we have now dispersion.

393
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,860
And that's the theme of our predictions.

394
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,740
The ability to distribute products and services over a wide area

395
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:03,220
and where and when they are needed most, removing unnecessary friction and costs.

396
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,860
First big trend, dispersion of headquarters, right?

397
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,220
If you want to hear denial, get someone who owns an office building

398
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,780
at a movie theater in the same room.

399
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,900
Oh, people can't wait to get work back to work.

400
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,420
No, they can't. People can wait.

401
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,340
There is a cohort that wants to go back to work,

402
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,580
specifically young people looking for mentors, friends and mates.

403
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,820
A third of people meet their mate at work.

404
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,220
By the way, that's not necessarily a bad thing.

405
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,940
Different talk show.

406
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:31,180
However, we're going to see a dispersion of headquarters to residential,

407
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:35,100
specifically commercial real estate is going to move to residential.

408
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,180
We're also going to see a Renaissance and co-working.

409
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:41,540
I'm not a big fan of WeWork, but we're going to see co-working pop up again.

410
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,620
Why? Because most people are still working from home.

411
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:48,500
And even when they return, they're going to be used to having the flexibility

412
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,780
to stay at home, which will absolutely decrease

413
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,980
the cost of the building.

414
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:58,460
And we're going to see a need for a renewed need for co-working space.

415
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,420
Just look at San Francisco.

416
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:04,580
Co-working space to a certain level takes out the volatility

417
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:09,580
of both the cost on the demand and the supply side of commercial real estate.

418
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,900
In just 12 months, this is crazy.

419
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:16,460
San Francisco registered its lowest vacancy rate ever commercially

420
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,860
and then its highest.

421
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,660
That's what a pandemic will do to you.

422
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,220
We're also seeing a lot of people are increased number of searches,

423
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:25,340
Google searches for co-working, and we see a lot of firms

424
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:28,660
who are permanently adopting a work from home option.

425
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,460
Young people more than anyone want to be in offices.

426
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:34,940
You're seeing Facebook and Google and Amazon double down on urban real estate.

427
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:38,620
Huge leases signed in New York because they realize the key to their business,

428
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:42,100
the secret sauce is a double E 25 year old out of Dartmouth.

429
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,700
And she wants to spend a couple of years in New York.

430
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,300
And they're building these Xanadu like campuses for the cohorts,

431
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,900
specifically young people that want to come back to the office.

432
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:56,100
Prediction Airbnb will be bigger than the top five hotel chains combined

433
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,500
and hits $200 a share in some.

434
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,700
This is the strongest brand in the history of hospitality.

435
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:07,100
Look at the number of searches for any city when you're looking for a hotel room.

436
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,500
They dwarf every other search for hospitality combined.

437
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,300
Nobody's searching for a hotel room.

438
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,300
Every other search for hospitality combined.

439
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:17,500
Nobody says, oh, I got an Expedia in San Francisco.

440
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,500
Oh, I decided to get a booking.com on my business trip.

441
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:25,500
No one says that this is the strongest, biggest, deepest brand

442
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,500
in the history of hospitality or travel.

443
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,300
Seven million rooms more than the biggest players combined.

444
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,500
And also also a true tech company that has a greater percentage of their employees

445
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:40,700
are actual technologists or engineers greater than Amazon, Lyft or Uber.

446
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,100
We have a juggernaut here.

447
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,300
We have a juggernaut.

448
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,500
I predicted that this thing would be worth $100 billion in the IPO.

449
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,100
I was wrong.

450
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,100
It was worth 90, but it's worth more.

451
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,300
Look at how much it's worth right now or will be worth.

452
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,300
I believe it's going to be $120 billion by the end of the year,

453
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,100
which puts it at $200 a share.

454
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:02,700
I believe Restoration Hardware and Sonos will reach $1,000 and $40 a share respectively.

455
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,500
Why?

456
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,700
Because some of that trillions of dollars in commercial real estate

457
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,900
is going to disperse into the home and there just aren't that many good brands in the home.

458
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:14,800
Remember when you looked at a million or $2 million home and they bragged that they had a subzero freezer.

459
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,300
So a $2,500 item was being used to sell a million dollar home.

460
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:25,600
Well, Sonos and Restoration Hardware are two of the best brands in a sector that is about to absorb a trillion dollars

461
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,500
in unexpected stakeholder value and capital.

462
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:33,100
We've seen their stock prices increase, but it's just getting started in my view.

463
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,500
Disclosure. I don't know Sonos.

464
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,900
I don't own Sonos or Restoration Hardware.

465
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,600
And you're going to see these companies rocket.

466
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:46,200
Again, permanent, permanent demand destruction across a $10 to $12 trillion asset class.

467
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,500
And where is that money going to go?

468
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,100
It's going to go into residential.

469
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:54,000
Who else here has realized, well, that carpet looks really shitty or maybe I need a nicer apartment

470
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,600
or maybe it's time I put in drapes or I would like, I don't know,

471
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,000
it smells kind of funny in here.

472
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,100
I'm going to make it nicer.

473
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,500
That is what everyone is thinking in every house across America.

474
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:09,700
Plywood costs and residential real estate have hit all time highs and we're just getting started.

475
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,000
Why else?

476
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,600
We spent 17% of our budget on transportation.

477
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,700
We're not commuting as much.

478
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,100
What are we going to do with that money?

479
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:21,800
We're going to put it where we're not commuting from specifically our homes.

480
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,600
What does this mean?

481
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:29,900
The great dispersion of HQ to residential is going to be amazing for the brands on top of the x-axis here

482
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:35,800
and it's going to be an incredible shedding of value from some of the companies below the x-axis here.

483
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,200
Apple acquires Peloton.

484
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,300
That's right.

485
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:47,200
There has never been a brand that better fits to another brand than Peloton does to Apple.

486
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,400
Why?

487
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,900
There's a dispersion of the sweat of the industrial sweat complex to the home.

488
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,300
Simply put, gyms are dying.

489
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,300
There will be a mild resurgence.

490
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:04,600
They will still exist, but we're going to lose somewhere between 10 and 30% of that value of gyms.

491
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,600
Where's it going to go?

492
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,200
Into your garage and into different types of weights.

493
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,800
Look at what's happened to work at home equipment.

494
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,300
It is absolutely surged.

495
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,100
Peloton.

496
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,600
It's better to be lucky than good.

497
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:20,800
Peloton is both and you're going to see Apple come in and decide, I know, I know we want connected fitness.

498
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:28,000
We want connected fitness in this incredible company that has Apple like brand, Apple like margins.

499
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,100
And has a market capitalization of 32 billion dollars, which is crazy.

500
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,000
Maybe overvalued.

501
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Maybe not.

502
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,100
Was Jet.com worth 3 billion dollars?

503
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:36,400
No.

504
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,800
Was it worth 10 billion dollars?

505
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,500
Probably to Walmart.

506
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,200
Yes.

507
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,900
Is Peloton worth 33 billion dollars?

508
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,700
I don't know.

509
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,300
Is it worth more than that to Apple?

510
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,000
Yes.

511
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,300
Apple has a 2 trillion dollar market capitalization.

512
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:52,300
That means that they pay a 30% premium and pay 40 billion.

513
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:57,700
That's a 2% dilution to acquire connected fitness in the home.

514
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,900
And what does that mean?

515
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:02,000
They get more and more of the all-important attention graph.

516
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,400
And that's what they are all trying to do.

517
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:07,600
They're all trying to be the access code, the operating system for our digital lives.

518
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,800
And this would be a baller move that increases anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes a day.

519
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,100
The amount of time you are staring at iOS.

520
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,600
Dispersion of retail.

521
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,200
First it went to warehouses in your doorstep.

522
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,300
Now it's moving to our phones and our tablets.

523
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:24,800
There'll be big acquisitions by Shopify and or Zoom.

524
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,600
These stocks are so rich.

525
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,300
This currency is so incredibly inflated.

526
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,500
I'm not sure I'd say overvalued because they're incredible performers,

527
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,300
but they are going to go shopping.

528
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,400
They are going to go shopping.

529
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,200
We haven't seen anything like this.

530
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,400
Good for them.

531
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:45,100
Shopify a 41 fold since in the last five years.

532
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:49,800
That gives me the ability and the need to go buy real EBITDA.

533
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,900
We've also seen incredible acceleration in the GMV they manage,

534
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,900
but they haven't made any acquisitions.

535
00:27:54,900 --> 00:28:00,100
I expect they will make an enormous acquisition in 2021.

536
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,800
The stock performance, obviously extraordinary here of Zoom.

537
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,900
113 billion.

538
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,800
I am less bullish on Zoom.

539
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,300
I do not think it is as sustainable.

540
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:14,400
I believe that Zoom will either acquire or merge with a big, big company in 2021.

541
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:21,100
And the real interesting thing here, Zoom could be the AOL of 2021.

542
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,100
Why? Why?

543
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,400
They are up against.

544
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,000
They think they're a great white shark.

545
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,500
They think they're the badass of the ocean, but the apex predator simply put an orca,

546
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:35,700
which is smarter that is Microsoft with Teams and Salesforce with Slack might show up

547
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,100
and offer video and eat their lunch.

548
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:44,800
I think Zoom is very vulnerable and this 113 billion dollar market capitalization is

549
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,900
likely inflated.

550
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:53,300
They will recognize this and try and pull a Steve Case and merge with a traditional

551
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,400
big EBITDA company, maybe another Telco.

552
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:01,500
And I believe that merger will likely go down in history as one of the worst mergers

553
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,100
or acquisitions in history.

554
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:06,400
Zoom either has to buy their way out of this or sell.

555
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,700
This is not sustainable.

556
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:12,300
They are playing with giants and the giant is about to smack them hard.

557
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:16,900
They need to either hook up with an Atlassian, develop some sort of suite here,

558
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:20,200
but as a standalone entity, they are like single title publishing.

559
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,700
They are vulnerable.

560
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:25,200
What would be an interesting acquisition or an interesting merger?

561
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,000
Zoom and WhatsApp, which will be spun whether Zuckerberg likes it or not.

562
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,600
There will be a for sale of WhatsApp.

563
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,500
The dispersion of creativity.

564
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,400
Get the traditional gatekeepers out of the way.

565
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,100
An example, Etsy, which I think is just inspiring.

566
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:43,000
I would have thought they would have gotten run over by Amazon, but anyway, it's good for them.

567
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,900
Roblox will triple in value.

568
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:49,600
This is an incredible company that actually gives a good goddamn about safety in children.

569
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:57,900
It has a flywheel effect that helps people, helps creators do incredible games for kids.

570
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:01,800
Over a third of their revenues goes out to their creators.

571
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:08,300
Over 50% of kids in the US under the age of 16 have been on Roblox in the last 30 days.

572
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:13,500
This is arguably the most influential company in history as it relates to children.

573
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,200
And at the same time, they recognize how important this is.

574
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,400
So in their S1, they mentioned safety 60 times.

575
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,700
They mentioned parental six times, right?

576
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:28,000
This is what we had hoped that Facebook would have been had it not been run by a sociopath.

577
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Roblox is the social media company we all wanted.

578
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,200
It is a true platform.

579
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:37,000
By the way, by the way, 79% of their employees are technologists.

580
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,600
Roblox is more of a tech company than Google or any other tech company.

581
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,800
This is an incredible firm.

582
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,600
When's the last time you saw an IPO pulled because the market was so strong?

583
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,200
They thought maybe we're not thinking big enough.

584
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:58,200
We're seeing that the next DaVinci, the next Frescoes, the next real creative voices

585
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,000
are going to come from different platforms.

586
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
We're seeing the traditional gatekeepers, whether it's the Pope or the Medici's

587
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,000
or whether it's movie studios or creative executives being sort of shifted aside

588
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,100
and saying with your iPhone and this platform, we're going to let the end consumer decide

589
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:17,800
what is the creativity that they want to absorb.

590
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,800
By the way, I said DaVinci, that's actually Michelangelo.

591
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,800
And by the way, I would have heard that I would have gotten like 10 or 15 comments

592
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,900
in my Twitter feed and my LinkedIn profile from the guardians of gotcha.

593
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,200
Save your breath.

594
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,700
A gaming platform fit for the great dispersion.

595
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:35,500
250 million a year, almost three hours a day, more than double.

596
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,800
Kids are spending more than double the time on Roblox.

597
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,200
They're spending on TikTok.

598
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,700
And again, the majority of US children on this platform and incredible flywheel.

599
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,900
You get the point.

600
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,800
Where is this dispersion going?

601
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,100
We're going to see many of these platforms accelerate.

602
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:53,500
I'm going to see many of the traditional gatekeepers get their shit kicked out of them

603
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:57,400
because they like the existing film creative industrial complex, right?

604
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:01,900
Podcasts get featurized and there's a flurry of acquisitions.

605
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,900
Why?

606
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:09,400
If you have an industry where there's high NPS and low multiples and low revenues,

607
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:13,900
then it makes sense for a low NPS high revenue company to come in and say,

608
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:18,200
I know, I know if we launch transparent and the marvelous Mrs.

609
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:25,300
Maisel and people like us more and we just decrease churn from 80% to 70% or we

610
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:29,400
decrease, we increase renewal from 90% to 93%.

611
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:34,200
We can monetize it in some in some high NPS products are used to sell more paper

612
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,900
towels and more handsets.

613
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,800
And the ultimate arbitrage here is in podcasting.

614
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:43,700
People are very fond and have real goodwill towards their favorite podcast.

615
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,200
But but the industry is so small.

616
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,000
It hasn't really been monetized.

617
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,100
So you see these incredible arbitrage deals.

618
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,800
Hollywood's essentially been featurized.

619
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:56,500
It used to be a business that had to be profitable in and among itself.

620
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,500
But the big guys realized, you know what?

621
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:03,000
I can spend more money than I take in as long as I sign up more prime memberships

622
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,700
and sell more handsets.

623
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,400
This is effectively featurized all of entertainment where it's no longer a

624
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:13,800
business in and among itself, but simply a feature to differentiate a better

625
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,600
business specifically big tech.

626
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,200
They're all going vertical.

627
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,300
What happened when House of Cards was launched on Netflix and they went

628
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,400
vertical their stock skyrocketed.

629
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,400
It's happening again.

630
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:28,600
Look at what happened when Spotify was just not vertical not investing in

631
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:32,600
proprietary differentiated content not increasing their NPS and then they do

632
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,800
a hundred million dollar deal.

633
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:38,700
By the way, Joe Rogan got ripped off the stocks up 126 percent since they

634
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,700
announced this deal.

635
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:45,900
There's going to be a race to acquire this high NPS talent to differentiate

636
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,700
platforms who can monetize it to a much greater extent than these companies

637
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,300
can monetize themselves again.

638
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:57,800
It's the arbitrage of NPS take every independent podcast across all categories

639
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,700
and they're starting to get calls from the bigger platform saying hey, what

640
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,200
do you make you make 5 million?

641
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,700
Would you like 50 million?

642
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,400
Because all I need is one basis point 50 basis point increase in my NPS and I

643
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:13,400
can monetize it to a greater extent and you're still the cheapest way for me to

644
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,400
differentiate myself a hundred million dollars or Joe Rogan.

645
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:20,100
He got ripped off are going to see a dispersion of education.

646
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
We're going to see more unicorns and Edtech than almost any other sectors a

647
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,700
percentage of how many unicorns are now why because people as such as myself

648
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:34,700
and my boss have transferred 1.6 trillion dollars in wealth for middle

649
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,700
class households to universities.

650
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:40,500
Why so University administrators can have less accountability and make more

651
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:44,400
money if it sounds morally corrupt trust your instincts.

652
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:48,600
What's happening huge disruption specifically at the hands of our cash

653
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:52,000
chow cows that have decided they don't want to show up to a covid infested

654
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:59,000
racist country called the US and we're seeing an absolute destruction or an

655
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:02,900
absenteeism of international students who are our cash cows the number of

656
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:08,000
international students that show up for the first time is off 43% and it is

657
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,100
declined 16% in general.

658
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:13,800
Look at the number of international students are the decline in the number of

659
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,200
international students as a percentage of student body the top MBA programs.

660
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:22,600
This is just in 12 months in some in some they're just not coming to school.

661
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,800
We did an analysis of which universities would be hit hardest or do the best

662
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,200
post covid our methodology simple.

663
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,400
We looked at value their credential essentially the brand we looked at the

664
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,100
experience is based on a company called Niche of student life and we looked at

665
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,400
the NPV the present value of the bump you got from that education in that

666
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,100
credential.

667
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,700
We then did all of this or set all of this over tuition and we looked at

668
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:52,000
vulnerabilities specifically the shock absorber of the endowment for student

669
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,800
job a lot of money you can weather almost any storm and also their

670
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,800
vulnerability around those international students or their cash cows more

671
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,800
international students the more cash cows you're likely going to lose during

672
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:08,100
the pandemic and then and then we just articulated and parses into four

673
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:12,500
quadrants and what did I get the next day a lot of activity on this post

674
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,300
probably more activity on this post than I've ever received and for the first

675
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:20,400
time not one not two, but three cease and desist letters isn't it night isn't

676
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,000
it nice to be threatened to spend 35 years of your life without ever getting

677
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:30,100
any sort of legal action threatened much less pursued and then to have

678
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:33,900
chancellors and University administrators send you cease and desist

679
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:38,500
letters specifically they wanted us to say this data is not accurate and stop

680
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,000
trashing us because we're worried our students aren't going to show up and

681
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,400
pay full freight for our near Ivy like experience that we're overcharging for

682
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:51,400
when we when we foist the feces of a university like experience in other

683
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:55,500
words give them a Hyundai worth of education for Mercedes like price we're

684
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:59,500
going to see a massive inflow into the disruption of Ed Tech 750 billion

685
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,700
dollars is no longer to be getting dispersed through the traditional

686
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:07,700
channels of universities and as a result we're going to see an explosion

687
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,100
and remote and online learning and also hybrids that partner with universities

688
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:16,400
the dispersion in healthcare is probably the most exciting disruptive

689
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:21,800
transition and stakeholder value in history Walmart Walmart is going to

690
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:26,200
continue to get further deeper deeper into healthcare with acquisitions our

691
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,100
health care in this country is shameful we spend more than any country in the

692
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:34,500
world except we have worse outcomes so the way to describe health healthcare

693
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:39,500
would be the same way to describe San Francisco as a city expensive but bad

694
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:46,300
Walmart has the scale they actually actually have a fantastic means of

695
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:51,300
testing their healthcare and Walmart there's a Walmart closer to Americans

696
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:56,100
and most hospitals they're going to roll out a healthcare incrementally through

697
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:59,500
acquisitions and innovations similar to what they're doing with their health

698
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:03,500
clinics where they offer primary care and standard procedures at a very

699
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:08,200
reasonable cost Amazon will begin to perform the Jedi mind trick they

700
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:12,600
perform on most industries on healthcare and over the next 12 months they will

701
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:16,600
Literally grab a hundred billion dollars from existing healthcare companies just

702
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:20,400
by threatening to go into healthcare and just with press releases look what

703
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,400
happened look what happened to these guys every time Amazon announces good

704
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,300
numbers its stock goes up and other retailers go down why because people have

705
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:31,400
figured out what's good for Amazon is bad for the rest of retail well what is

706
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:36,600
about to be good for Amazon is about to be bad for the rest of healthcare.

707
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,900
This is a company that added one and a half trillion dollars at the expense of

708
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,800
other retailers.

709
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,800
What does it need to do though?

710
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,400
It has a lot of it has a problem the law big numbers it needs to add about a

711
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,500
half a quarter of a trillion dollars in top line revenue to maintain the

712
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,900
velocity of its stock.

713
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,900
It's going to go after healthcare healthcare companies the 10 biggest at

714
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:56,200
it 80 billion dollars in market capitalization.

715
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,200
What does that mean?

716
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,100
What does that mean?

717
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:01,900
Where's that coming from when Amazon announces that it's doing something with

718
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:06,000
Berkshire Hathaway and JP Morgan everybody else begins to shed value to

719
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,900
Amazon and we're going to see the same thing over and over this year the

720
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,200
dispersion of markets right.

721
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,800
We're no longer going into brokerages.

722
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,500
We're no longer dealing with stockbrokers.

723
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,100
It's coming to our handheld phone.

724
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,200
Dispersion is not all good.

725
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,200
There are some very dangerous things because it disperses and it skips not

726
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,900
only channels of distribution.

727
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:28,500
It can skip regulation or sometimes needed needed friction.

728
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:33,700
I believe 2021 is the year we get a new menace that joins Robin Hood or excuse

729
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:37,400
me the joins lift and uber and Facebook.

730
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:44,300
The new menace is online trading app Robin Hood Robin Hood traders trade 88

731
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:49,300
times the number of options when size adjusted is any other platform.

732
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:54,800
We also have an organization that is not thinking of its investors as as the

733
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,000
customer but the product that produces data that they then sell to other hedge

734
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,100
funds who front run these trades or want insight and what the dumb money is

735
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:07,100
doing and they are able to garner much more revenue than any other firm based

736
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:10,400
on the trading data of their products specifically their consumers.

737
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,700
What could go wrong here options that is total share of revenues is very dangerous

738
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:20,700
exotic instruments that are not for first-time investors over index at Robin

739
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:24,800
Hood and we're also seeing the algebra of deterrence is not working here.

740
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:28,500
The SEC is now find them for a second time for not being transparent around

741
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,500
how they are monetizing their consumers data.

742
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:35,500
They find them 2 million and 10 million and guess what Robin Hood like Facebook

743
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,400
just don't give a shit right?

744
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,000
Why would you if you have a parking meter in front of your house that costs

745
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,500
a hundred bucks and the ticket is 25 cents.

746
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:46,200
Let's break the law and that's what Robin Hood is doing similar to what

747
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,800
Facebook did when they continue to wave the middle finger in the face of

748
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,100
regulators because doesn't matter we can write we can stroke a track for

749
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,100
five billion dollars.

750
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,600
That's about 11 days of cash flow.

751
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,600
Look at Charles Schwab when you want to invest you get messages saying the

752
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:04,100
following make sure you have your short-term needs covered a relatively

753
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,000
low-risk investment.

754
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,200
What happens when you go on to the Robin Hood app right?

755
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,000
Hi there instant access.

756
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,300
You're going to get instant deposits get your get your first free share of

757
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:20,000
stock now and then you do anything and boom boom what happens it starts to

758
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,500
rain confetti.

759
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:26,400
Let's create behavioral triggers that release dopamine and get you addicted

760
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,600
in a bull market.

761
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,000
What could go wrong?

762
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
We are considering additional criteria and education for customers seeking

763
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,800
level 3 options authorization to help ensure customers understand more

764
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,000
sophisticated options trading.

765
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,900
What are they talking about?

766
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:44,400
They're talking about their response to a 20 year old Alex Kearns who

767
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,800
received an errant incorrect statement from Robin Hood saying that he was

768
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:55,900
down $700,000 no the firm $700,000 and seeing no way out decided that his

769
00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:01,300
way out was to throw himself in front of a train and this is their response

770
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:06,100
and to be fair what have they done fucking nothing.

771
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,200
I don't know these two founders.

772
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:13,200
All I know is they don't have sons if we could go back in time and stop one

773
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,700
menace from depressing our teens and weaponizing our elections.

774
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,300
Would we do anything about it?

775
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,000
That's where we are now.

776
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,600
These two are menaces.

777
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,500
There is good news.

778
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:29,200
The good news the Massachusetts Secretary of Commonwealth Galvin says Robin

779
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:33,200
Hood is a reckless company gamifying investing more of this to come.

780
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,700
Goldman Sachs CEO puts out a very thoughtful note that the markets

781
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:41,800
who ever valued it's bad all this volatility yet they've decided they're

782
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,600
going to be the lead underwriter for Robin Hood boss.

783
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:49,100
Walk the walk make the music match the words.

784
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:53,100
This company has no business in the market supposedly when Robin Hood had

785
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:58,800
an outage last week volatility skyrocketed and volume went way down.

786
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,700
What could go wrong?

787
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,100
This firm is not only bad for young men.

788
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:07,400
It is bad for the markets and inject systemic risk into the markets.

789
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:11,000
Next prediction spacks underperform.

790
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,900
We've seen record levels of spacks, right?

791
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:19,700
I mean unbelievable number of spacks record year and we're seeing about

792
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,500
we've seen about 70 billion dollars.

793
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:25,700
It is still unspacked meaning it's been raised but they haven't found a target

794
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:28,100
special-purpose acquisition Corp.

795
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:31,300
You go raise money and then you say I'm going to go find a target.

796
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:34,600
I've done all the hard work of getting a company public boom just add water

797
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,700
public company they get to be they get to trade right away.

798
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:40,600
And so we're going to go out and find a great private company.

799
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,800
So 70 billion dollars.

800
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:46,600
It's usually it's usually leveraged two or three to one with additional debt

801
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:51,300
once they find a target once they find a target, but we've seen incredible

802
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:55,900
incredible interest in this because never underestimate the markets ability

803
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,600
to produce a product when people have cash in their hand.

804
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:01,600
Just think of it as when you're in New York and it starts to rain before

805
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,200
you know it.

806
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,200
There's umbrellas for sale everywhere.

807
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:08,300
Well, there are a ton of umbrellas for sale right now in the form of spacks.

808
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,500
What does this mean?

809
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:13,200
There's 200 billion dollars searching for private companies right now.

810
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:18,000
That means that these spacks by General Motors Ford, Boeing Fiat Chrysler

811
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,300
Delta United JetBlue and American Airlines.

812
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,500
They would still have money.

813
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,300
The question is are there that many great private companies that are sort

814
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:33,400
of IPO ready and most likely the answer is no Bitcoin or passes $50,000 as

815
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,400
we've been writing this or preparing we've been working on this presentation

816
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:36,900
for a month.

817
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:40,200
I think Bitcoin is up five to $7,000.

818
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,200
I think of Bitcoin.

819
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,200
I don't fully understand it.

820
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:47,200
I had Michael Saylor on the prop G pod yesterday to try and explain it to me

821
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:47,800
and I got to be honest.

822
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,100
I still don't fully understand Bitcoin.

823
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:53,700
But the way I think about it is I think about it as a company and a brand and

824
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:57,300
right now even with its run up to I think 23,000 today.

825
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:00,000
It has a market capitalization of $400 billion.

826
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,200
So if you took all the coins time to value, it's 400 billion.

827
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,900
It's about the worth of Johnson & Johnson.

828
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:09,100
I think of this thing though is somewhat true or not.

829
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:12,000
Its perception is it's a hedge against inflation.

830
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,800
It represents Liberty and it represents the new gold and the thing about this is

831
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:23,700
you can create a go bag and you can stick $10 million of gold in your head with

832
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:28,700
an access code where you can't do that with gold or you can do with Bitcoin.

833
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:29,600
You can't do with gold.

834
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:34,200
I believe this asset class is going to breach a trillion dollars, which means

835
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:38,300
it goes to $50,000 if that sounds like very unsophisticated analysis,

836
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,700
trust your instincts, but that doesn't mean I'm wrong.

837
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:42,900
Doesn't mean I'm wrong.

838
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:46,300
This thing is now Bitcoin is now getting the institutional support to give people

839
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:51,900
the security mainline investors to start putting a percentage of their assets in to Bitcoin.

840
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:57,500
And then if you look at the government's ability, all government's ability to just print

841
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:02,200
tremendous amounts of money, you could make an argument that in fact cash is going to

842
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:07,800
incur a decrease in purchasing power and that this might be seen as a more sophisticated,

843
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:13,700
more millennial, more hip version of gold as a hedge to inflation that may in fact

844
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:18,000
become a tangible threat soon.

845
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,600
This is evidenced by the fact that the increase in Bitcoin seems to be inversely correlated

846
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:27,600
to people pulling out funds or correlated to people pulling funds out of gold ETFs.

847
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:31,900
In other words, people perceive Bitcoin as being gold like and are transferring their

848
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:34,000
assets in gold into Bitcoin.

849
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,900
And by the way, there's a lot more than $400 billion invested in gold right now.

850
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,400
Let's talk about the dispersion of media.

851
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:43,500
Disney stock will rise 30% on move to a Rondo.

852
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:48,200
The gangster move here, what happens when you move to recurring revenue?

853
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:54,100
Well, the red bar is the increase in revenue and the blue bar is the increase in stock price.

854
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:58,700
So how do these companies arbitrage this increase in revenue with an outsized increase in

855
00:46:58,700 --> 00:46:59,600
stakeholder value?

856
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:02,900
Simple, they move to a recurring revenue bundle and Disney is prime.

857
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:06,200
They have the assets and they are about to go full Rondo.

858
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:10,300
Now we made this prediction again about a month ago and the stock is up 20 or 30% since

859
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:12,400
then, but it still has a lot of legs.

860
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:17,800
Go on LinkedIn, go on LinkedIn, do some basic searches and you can find out they are lining

861
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,500
up the Rondo tanks at the border.

862
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:21,800
Look at all the job.

863
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,800
Look at the descriptions of all the jobs.

864
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,100
They are looking to fill right now.

865
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:30,900
They've also done a major reord to go full Rondo and rally around Disney Plus.

866
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:31,200
Why?

867
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,700
Because they've decided what is strategy?

868
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:36,300
All strategy boils down to one thing.

869
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,000
What can we do?

870
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,900
It is really hard that other people can't do.

871
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:47,500
Well, what other people can't do is launch a series on young Lando or take Jedi Ashoka

872
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:53,200
and put her on TV or monetize the hundred billion dollars in acquisitions of Pixar,

873
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,100
Lucasfilm and Marvel.

874
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:58,300
This company has so much momentum right now.

875
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:02,700
Oh, and by the way, let's give people a baby Yoda doll and give them the opportunity to

876
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:08,700
take their sons to Disney and have a special Edge of Galaxy experience.

877
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:09,900
So they make their own lightsabers.

878
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:13,000
Oh, and by the way, if you want to come to our parks when it's not crowded, you need

879
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,400
to be a Disney Plus member and maybe even we get you a better cabin on Disney Cruises.

880
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,000
This is the ultimate Rondo.

881
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,600
Anyone with kids has to join this thing called Disney Plus.

882
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:26,000
They'll have pricing power and the marketplace will look at their revenues and it'll recast

883
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,400
the multiple on this company similar to what's happened to Apple over the last five years.

884
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:35,100
We wrote about this by the way, just as snap has been the product planning and development

885
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:37,600
for Facebook.

886
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:41,600
Who has been the strategy department for AT&T and Disney?

887
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:44,700
That's right us.

888
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,300
Anyway, we're going full Rondo late TNT stock.

889
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:52,200
It's $40 a share and or divest HP or CNN.

890
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,200
They had an acquisition.

891
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:57,000
They've lost control of the narrative stocks are now more narrative than they are numbers

892
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,400
and they've lost control the narrative the narrative right now is basically the following.

893
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:05,000
It's basically you made a bad acquisition when they are going to get control of the narrative.

894
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,200
They're going to take it back.

895
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:10,500
They did the baller move here despite all the complaints of people making tens of millions

896
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:15,000
of dollars with the existing channels of film and does what a shocker that the head of CAA

897
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,300
and Christopher Nolan making between 10 and 50 million dollars a year off the existing

898
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:21,000
infrastructure think it's a really bad idea.

899
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,300
They should have a petty party hosted by Jeffrey Katzenberg with Billy Squire and Alan Thicke

900
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:30,900
or Robin Thicke play and it could be catered by Planet Hollywood thought that'd be funnier.

901
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,300
That didn't quite work out.

902
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:37,000
We are going to see the multiple on AT&T go up for every one basis point and multiple

903
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,600
that AT&T gets back by recasting and reclaiming the narrative.

904
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:45,500
They increase their market capitalization by 1.7 billion dollars and this is how they're

905
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:46,500
going to do it.

906
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:50,500
This was the baller move of media when they decided to take everything directly to HBO

907
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:55,400
Max and by the way who decided to agree to their terms all of a sudden Roku why because

908
00:49:55,400 --> 00:50:01,300
HBO Max has just gotten a giant EpiPen tea therapy whatever the hell you want to call

909
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,300
it.

910
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:07,000
They all of a sudden have unbelievable new mojo and they are either going to show every

911
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:13,900
invigorated story that'll take AT&T stock up or they will spin HBO and possibly CNN

912
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:18,600
who is going to go behind to pay while why because advertising is a tax on the poor and

913
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:23,100
the technologically literate and no good content should be ad supported.

914
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:28,200
We spend two weeks a year watching commercials read Zakaria one of my professional role models

915
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:34,700
amazing show 14 minutes of commercial time and what do they get for that for pelting

916
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:38,740
you with reminders how much it sucks to get old and say we can solve your opioid induced

917
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:41,600
constipation or make your legs less restless.

918
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:47,700
They get 23 cents for shoveling that shit down your throat right or for 14 minutes of

919
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:55,140
ads they get 23 cents from an advertiser and this is a great show that advertisers love.

920
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:59,480
Another way of thinking about this is the advertising industrial complex and Time Warner

921
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:02,940
believes that your time is worth approximately a dollar an hour.

922
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:03,940
No it's not.

923
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:07,980
No it's not your time is worth more at least a buck ten maybe more maybe more.

924
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:09,340
So what are they going to do?

925
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:12,520
They're going to recognize the way you create trillions of dollars or at least billions

926
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:15,320
of dollars in shareholder values from a time machine.

927
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:19,740
Netflix isn't a media company it's a time machine if you only let your kids watch Netflix

928
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:24,940
they save two weeks of their life a year with advertising the markets realize this and

929
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:30,180
realize non ad supported recurring revenue companies are a better business and have taken

930
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:34,500
their stocks up substantially over the last 12 months.

931
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,180
It's a better business model.

932
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:38,140
What's the most bulletproof media company in the world right now?

933
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:39,140
The New York Times.

934
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:42,900
It's not old versus new it's subscription versus ad base and the New York Times which

935
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:46,660
gets two thirds of its revenue from subscription is now monetizing them through the tomb of

936
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:49,420
sixty six bucks apiece.

937
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:54,460
We're going to see the best content on the progressive side go behind a paywall.

938
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:55,980
Let's summarize.

939
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:59,340
This is the beginning of the end of big tech as we know it.

940
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:01,060
We're going to see antitrust.

941
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:05,620
However, however, Facebook stock will increase in the face of antitrust is the only person

942
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:11,060
who loses here is the Zuck and Amazon is going to prophylactically spin a WS.

943
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:17,060
The dispersion of HQ is going to result in a co-working Renaissance restoration hardware

944
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:21,700
becomes a breaches a thousand Sony Sonos forty dollars a share.

945
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:24,900
The Apple B becomes worth more than Uber.

946
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:25,900
Apple acquires Peloton.

947
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:31,660
We're seeing a dispersion of retail big acquisitions for Shopify and or Zoom which could be seen

948
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:33,460
as the AOL of 2021.

949
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:37,460
This thing is very vulnerable sitting on top of a hundred and twenty billion dollar market

950
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:38,460
cap.

951
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:40,020
We're seeing a dispersion of education.

952
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:43,820
We're going to see more unicorns and education as a percentage of existing unicorns of any

953
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:44,820
other sector.

954
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:46,540
We're seeing a dispersion of creativity.

955
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:48,780
Roblox triples in value.

956
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:52,820
Podcasts get feature eyes and we see a flurry of acquisitions of the strongest ones that

957
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:53,820
are still independent.

958
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:55,380
A dispersion of markets.

959
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:59,380
People are recognizing that dispersion is not necessarily a good thing if we don't have

960
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:00,380
friction of regulation.

961
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:02,740
Robinhood is being recognized for what it is.

962
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:03,740
A menace.

963
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:05,620
Spacks will underperform.

964
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:08,100
There's too many hunting too few good companies.

965
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:10,820
Bitcoin hits fifty thousand dollars.

966
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:13,180
We see a dispersion of health care.

967
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:15,500
Walmart gets into health care via acquisition.

968
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:20,180
Amazon starts to perform their Jedi mind trick and drain the ten biggest health care companies

969
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:21,180
of their market capitalization.

970
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:23,020
And we're seeing a dispersion of media.

971
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:27,900
Disney stock will continue to accelerate based on their ballerrundle.

972
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:32,060
It was a sleeping giant that was prodded and poked and is finally waking up.

973
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:39,500
AT&T stock hits forty dollars a share and or a divest HBO and CNN goes behind a paywall.

974
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,700
Let's open it up to questions.

975
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,220
Let's open it up to questions.

976
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:51,940
Go ahead.

977
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:57,100
Knowing that particularly in the US in 2020 we've seen both the stock market and unemployment

978
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:58,940
rise significantly.

979
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:02,820
Do you foresee there being meaningful steps taken by the government to address income

980
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:10,700
inequality in 2021 or do you imagine that we simply see the K-shaped recovery continue?

981
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:11,700
What's your name?

982
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:12,700
Katie.

983
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:13,700
Katie, where are you from, Katie?

984
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:14,700
Astoria, New York.

985
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:15,900
Katie from Astoria.

986
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:18,900
I hope so.

987
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:24,100
In New York, Katie, when you walk in the street, you are just as likely as we sit here and

988
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:30,140
now to find to run into somebody who has been to a food bank as has a college degree.

989
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:34,180
Thirty four percent of New Yorkers have been to a food bank in the last 30 days and 32

990
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:35,820
percent have a college degree.

991
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:40,860
So we now have a great state with the capital of the world as more people have been to a

992
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:43,540
food bank than have a college degree.

993
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:50,820
The stimulus of the pandemic was nothing but a corrupt government playing the economy

994
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:55,700
like a Stradivarius violin and figuring out a way to flatten the curve for rich people.

995
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:57,740
Small businesses didn't need a bailout.

996
00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:02,940
It's ridiculous that we've decided to keep restaurants open while maintaining schools,

997
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:04,180
letting schools stay closed.

998
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:10,300
We have decided to be very loving and empathetic towards companies and to be harsh and Darwinistic

999
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:11,300
towards individuals.

1000
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:16,660
The basis of capitalism, the only way capitalism works is when you flip that and that is you

1001
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:18,340
let companies go out of business.

1002
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:19,340
You let people get fired.

1003
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:20,340
You have Darwinism.

1004
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:24,340
You have full body contact violence at a corporate level, which creates incredible prosperity

1005
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:27,220
such that we can be more loving and empathetic to Americans.

1006
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:31,300
We can take 38 percent of seniors who are in poverty and take it down to 11 percent

1007
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:32,300
social security.

1008
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:35,740
We can take people who are hungry and say, sorry, you live in the wealthiest country

1009
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:36,740
in the world.

1010
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:37,740
We're not going to let you be hungry.

1011
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:38,740
That is snap.

1012
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:43,620
We have lost the script.

1013
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:48,180
I am hopeful that through a series of DOJ actions that economically go through and oxygenate

1014
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:53,540
the economy by breaking up big tech, I am hopeful that we have individuals and leadership

1015
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:55,180
now that feel some sense of empathy.

1016
00:55:55,180 --> 00:56:00,180
I'm hopeful that our citizenship has woken up to the fact that if we live in a nation

1017
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:03,740
that is not a nation, if we don't have some empathy, if we don't grab the hands of our

1018
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:08,260
sisters and brothers and recognize that we need to have progressive taxes, we need to

1019
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:11,580
redistribute income, that we can have the wealthiest nation in the world with people

1020
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:14,820
starving, that we have lost the script.

1021
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:17,420
Capitalism is absolutely collapsing on itself.

1022
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:20,980
I am hopeful we are at a juncture, but it is up to us.

1023
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:22,060
The world isn't what it is.

1024
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:23,260
The world is what we make of it.

1025
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:27,220
So I am very hopeful around the Biden-Harris administration, but we are going to have to

1026
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:31,220
give them cloud cover and decide that it is unacceptable for anyone in this country to

1027
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:32,220
be hungry.

1028
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:35,260
It is unacceptable for companies to dominate.

1029
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:39,620
It is unacceptable for a tyranny of private power to overwhelm our government.

1030
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:40,860
We need regulation.

1031
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:41,860
We need fair taxes.

1032
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:46,860
It is ridiculous that one man has more wealth than every individual in D.C., Vermont, Wyoming,

1033
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:52,540
Nevada, and Alaska, and adds the wealth of the Dakotas in a good week and doesn't pay

1034
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:53,540
any taxes.

1035
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:54,540
We have lost the script.

1036
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:59,340
Capitalism is about violence of corporations and empathy and love with people.

1037
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:01,180
We need to protect people, not companies.

1038
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:02,540
I am hopeful.

1039
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:03,740
I am hopeful.

1040
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:04,740
Next question.

1041
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:06,220
Hey, Scott.

1042
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:07,220
I am hopeful, too.

1043
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:08,220
Nice meeting you.

1044
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:15,780
My question is, toilet paper, PPE, and software that aids remote learning and working were

1045
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:19,020
like the hottest commodities of 2020.

1046
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:22,860
What is your prediction for the lineup of 2021 of those items?

1047
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:28,300
Well, I, okay, so let's talk about toilet paper and the pandemic.

1048
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:32,700
We are about to have the worst four months in American history in terms of loss of souls.

1049
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:36,060
We are going to lose more people in the next four or five months, and we lost in World

1050
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:41,180
War II because we have this cold comfort that a technology solution is here called a vaccine,

1051
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:43,980
and people are going to loosen their behavior, and we are going to have record levels of

1052
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:44,980
deaths.

1053
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:50,620
So I don't know if that's, you know, if you are saying terrible things around the pandemic

1054
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:54,300
are related to the sales of toilet paper, they will continue to escalate.

1055
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,780
I do think online learning is here to stay.

1056
00:57:56,780 --> 00:58:00,500
I had 280 kids in my class at Stern each paying $7,000.

1057
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:06,820
It's $1.96 million or $166,000 a night for me to do this.

1058
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:10,380
That is not sustainable, and I think a lot of people are going to decide to cherry pick

1059
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:13,640
individual classes or get certification at a lower.

1060
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:16,820
Calculus is a $2 billion business in America.

1061
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:19,780
Undergraduates pay $2 billion to take calculus classes.

1062
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:23,460
Outly or another company I have no investment in says, well, let's get the best calculus

1063
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:27,340
teacher that's been taught the same way for 100 years and give it to people, kids, for

1064
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:30,140
$300 instead of $7,000.

1065
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:34,540
So I think toilet paper, I think the pandemic, unfortunately, gets worse in terms of the

1066
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:38,100
toll it takes on Americans, but I'm hopeful about remote learning.

1067
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:39,500
I appreciate the question.

1068
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:40,500
Next question!

1069
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:43,180
Hi, Scott.

1070
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:49,460
I was inspired by your new episode on Bitcoin with Michael Saylor today, and he explained

1071
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:53,180
it very, very clearly as to what it is and the trajectory.

1072
00:58:53,180 --> 00:59:01,420
My question is, as a personal investor, what percentage would you dedicate to that Bitcoin

1073
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:06,380
compared to the overall investment portfolio, especially since we all agree that stocks

1074
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:08,620
are so frothy and overvalued?

1075
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:09,620
It's just stupid.

1076
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:15,220
So anyway, Bitcoin, percentage, investment portfolio allocation.

1077
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:16,220
What's your name?

1078
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:21,060
Where are you from?

1079
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:23,100
Your name and where are you from?

1080
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:25,020
Clara in Brooklyn.

1081
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:27,420
Clara in Brooklyn, New Yorkers today.

1082
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:32,580
Clara, so first off, read my colleague's Aswath de Moteran's blog.

1083
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:37,100
He's going to forget more than I'm going to know about diversification and allocation.

1084
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:38,920
I'll just give you a viewpoint.

1085
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:40,540
You look like you're in your 20s.

1086
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:41,540
You're young.

1087
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:43,020
You have a lot of time to make money.

1088
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:45,340
You always guess to the low side, Clara.

1089
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:47,460
You always guess to the low side.

1090
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:51,060
Anyways, anyways, you still have a decent amount of time to make money.

1091
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:55,820
So if you feel convicted about something, putting 10 or 20 percent of your net worth

1092
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:58,380
in something you really feel strongly about, I think is OK.

1093
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:02,220
I think as you get to be my age, you never want to have more than 10 percent of your

1094
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:05,540
worth in any one stock or asset class.

1095
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:09,940
So I would say if you're in love with Bitcoin, you know, at a minimum, maybe get your feet

1096
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:11,480
wet, see what the price says.

1097
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,660
When you get your feet wet, you start following it.

1098
01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:15,320
You start understanding it.

1099
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,060
You start getting comfortable with it.

1100
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:19,340
And then if it goes down, maybe buy a little bit more.

1101
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:21,320
You don't have to go all in at once.

1102
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:24,540
And then Bitcoin strikes me as the kind of thing where you want to buy it and forget

1103
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:25,540
about it.

1104
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:26,540
I think it's going to be volatile.

1105
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:28,020
But I believe I'm like you.

1106
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:30,020
I'm actually thinking of putting some money into Bitcoin.

1107
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:31,520
I don't own any.

1108
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:35,940
And I'm going to put somewhere between five and 10 percent of my net worth in it and just

1109
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:38,420
think of it as the kind of thing I'll give to my kids.

1110
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:42,260
And if shit gets real and there's some sort of like crazy market disruption, I'm going

1111
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:46,420
to hope that it is what everyone else says and it's a hedge against the rest of the world.

1112
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:51,340
But I also like to remind people that when the market dove in April, Bitcoin hit five

1113
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:52,340
thousand dollars.

1114
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:57,780
So I'm not sure there is truly any uncorrelated asset class circling back to your question.

1115
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:58,780
Dip your toes in.

1116
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:01,060
Try not to go above 10 percent.

1117
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:02,060
Learn about it.

1118
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:04,100
So I would say five to 10 percent.

1119
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:07,380
More importantly, go to somebody who knows what they're talking about and read ASOT,

1120
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:08,380
the Motorins blog.

1121
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:10,700
Thank you for the question.

1122
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:11,700
Last question.

1123
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:12,700
Thanks, Scott.

1124
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:13,700
There's two of them.

1125
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:14,780
Thanks, Scott.

1126
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:16,780
There's two of you.

1127
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:17,780
There's two of us.

1128
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:19,780
Who are you?

1129
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:20,780
Hey, I'm Jack.

1130
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:21,780
I'm Alex.

1131
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:24,780
Where are you calling from?

1132
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:26,780
We're in New York.

1133
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:27,780
Are you guys married?

1134
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:28,780
Are you living in sin?

1135
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:30,780
Living in sin.

1136
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:32,780
Oh, my gosh.

1137
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:36,780
This is the R-rated part of the live stream.

1138
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:37,780
Nice.

1139
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:38,780
All right.

1140
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:39,780
What's your question?

1141
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:45,300
So with so many companies on the coast looking at relocating, like Wall Street to Florida

1142
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:49,980
and Silicon Valley to Texas, what do you think happens to traditional mega cities and their

1143
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:53,300
subsequent commuter towns?

1144
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:55,900
I think the death of cities has been greatly exaggerated.

1145
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:59,100
San Francisco is just incredibly poorly run.

1146
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:00,820
And I lived in San Francisco for 10 years.

1147
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:02,220
Most beautiful city in the nation.

1148
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:04,200
It's expensive at bat, overpriced.

1149
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,380
That's just a micro climate.

1150
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:10,260
But cities are still the place that the most talented people in the world want to go to

1151
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:17,300
bump off, to get creativity, the serendipity of ideas, the grit, the culture, the great

1152
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:20,260
food, the great art.

1153
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:24,940
Cities are still going to be where two thirds of economic creativity, economic growth happens

1154
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:26,740
over the next 20 to 30 years.

1155
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:30,660
Advice to a young person, get certified, get to a city.

1156
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:34,580
Because once you start collecting dogs and kids, it's hard to stay in a city.

1157
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:37,140
So the time to get to a city is when you're young.

1158
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:40,180
You guys are probably, I'm going to assume you're double income, no children.

1159
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:44,140
The city is where you want to be.

1160
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:49,180
And granted, there'll be some people who already have careers, already have some money, already

1161
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:52,980
have kids, already have dogs who take advantage of the remote work from home and will move

1162
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:58,300
to the suburbs or move to more remote places and increase their quality of life.

1163
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:04,020
But the real friction, the real fire, the real fur that flies around stakeholder creation

1164
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:08,860
as it relates to corporations and creativity is going to be in these amazing things called cities.

1165
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:10,980
It might be Miami instead of San Francisco.

1166
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:14,140
It might be St. Louis instead of Chicago.

1167
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:20,780
But my advice to anyone under the age of 40 is get to a city, get to a city.

1168
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:23,220
Thank you so much.

1169
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:24,300
This has been great.

1170
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:28,820
We are going to wrap up with a quick notion on prosperity versus progress.

1171
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:32,500
This is very preachy, so I want to apologize in advance.

1172
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:39,820
This could be the best or the worst year in decades, or specifically my prediction is

1173
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:45,100
that 2021 is either the Renaissance of America or the point that everybody looks at in the

1174
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:48,980
history books as the decline of our civilization.

1175
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:52,900
This is either going to be the best year or the worst year in decades.

1176
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:55,540
Specifically, there's incredible opportunity.

1177
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:57,560
We could take education costs down.

1178
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:02,460
We could take admittance rates of UCLA back to where it was when I got in, 60% versus

1179
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:04,260
where it is now, 12%.

1180
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:08,940
We could get off our heels in terms of health care and provide primary care to people in

1181
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:11,280
need at a fraction of the cost using remote.

1182
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:15,420
This could be more time for fathers with their family.

1183
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:20,980
This could be more opportunity for people to bond, for mates and spouses to reconnect,

1184
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:25,780
for us to spend the kind of time we want to spend with our parents as they get infirmed

1185
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:26,780
and aged.

1186
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:31,060
There's an enormous opportunity for profitability as firms no longer have to spend 15% of their

1187
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:34,300
revenue on commercial real estate, but just five.

1188
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:40,220
We could permanently lower emissions through a reduction in commuting.

1189
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:45,500
We could spend less time in bad hotels eating bad salty food on shitty planes and hurting

1190
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:48,180
our backs and aging quickly.

1191
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:52,340
If there's anything that's taken 10 years off my life, it's business travel, which I

1192
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:54,460
used to do 200 days a year.

1193
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:56,660
Commuting is a tax on our souls.

1194
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:57,620
It could end.

1195
01:04:57,620 --> 01:04:59,060
Business travel could end.

1196
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:01,180
There's huge opportunities.

1197
01:05:01,180 --> 01:05:05,700
At the same time, there's some very, very unhealthy trends here.

1198
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:10,220
We have gone from a dysfunctional economy to a dystopic one.

1199
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:12,360
The 0.1% is killing it.

1200
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:18,860
We don't like to say this, the top 10%, which I'm in, the pandemic has meant if you're blessed

1201
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:23,100
enough to not have an impact on your health, it's meant more time with kids, Netflix, and

1202
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:25,620
your stocks are up.

1203
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:30,420
However, it's taken an enormous toll.

1204
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:34,420
One in six households food insecure with children.

1205
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:37,540
This is the scariest chart I've seen all year.

1206
01:05:37,540 --> 01:05:43,300
Typically, low-income kids track with middle and higher-income kids in public schools around

1207
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:44,860
math and science.

1208
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:50,260
But since COVID-19 and the introduction of remote learning, low-income kids have fallen

1209
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:51,740
off the map.

1210
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:52,740
Why?

1211
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:53,740
Maybe they don't have iPads.

1212
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:55,020
Maybe their iPads get stolen.

1213
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:56,100
Maybe they're not broadband.

1214
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:58,580
Maybe mom can't stay home and sit next to them.

1215
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:02,300
By the way, remote learning just basically means mom is now the teacher.

1216
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:04,900
Let's be honest, it's almost always the mom.

1217
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:06,620
But we've seen them fall off the map.

1218
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:11,820
Despite of the moral problems here, we're going to lose half our scientists.

1219
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:13,540
We're going to lose half our military leaders.

1220
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:15,920
We're going to lose half our civic leaders.

1221
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:19,620
We are literally losing a generation.

1222
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:24,580
We're also seeing incredible increases in unemployment among low-income people.

1223
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:27,820
If you make over $100,000 a year, there's been no change in unemployment.

1224
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:33,100
If you make less than $40,000 a year, there's a 40% likelihood you've had some interruption

1225
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:34,100
in your employment.

1226
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:36,980
We're also seeing small businesses get their shit kicked out of them.

1227
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:39,620
But wait, the NASDAQ's up.

1228
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:45,820
If our spending and our priorities are reflected in our national character, then we have said

1229
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:48,100
that losing half a million Americans would be bad.

1230
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:51,220
But what would be profoundly tragic is if the NASDAQ went down.

1231
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:54,100
This stimulus had nothing to do with saving people.

1232
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:57,500
This stimulus was about flattening the curve for rich people and seeing the markets go

1233
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:58,660
apeshit.

1234
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:00,100
We have lost the script.

1235
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:01,480
Should the markets be higher?

1236
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:03,620
Should rich people be wealthier?

1237
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:08,180
Coming out of the pandemic, just as food insecurity hits all-time highs and a third of Americans

1238
01:07:08,180 --> 01:07:11,700
are worried about paying their rent, this isn't capitalism.

1239
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:15,380
When you have capitalism on the way up and then you have bailouts for rich people and

1240
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:18,620
corporations on the way down, that's cronyism.

1241
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:20,540
No wonder young people don't buy into capitalism.

1242
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:22,940
We need to return to capitalism.

1243
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:24,620
We need more empathy.

1244
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:28,740
The hard part about dispersion as a cousin to dispersion is segregation.

1245
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:33,620
We no longer see the homeless veteran on the off ramp because we're not commuting to work.

1246
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:38,580
We no longer see people from different income levels or the single mother bringing us our

1247
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:41,020
food because we're not in restaurants and we're not in malls.

1248
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:44,700
We no longer see different people of different ethnicities because if we have any money,

1249
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:50,220
we send them to all white private schools or we don't in fact interact with people in

1250
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:51,220
different neighborhoods.

1251
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:57,540
The problem is when there's no segregation, our empathy decreases for other communities.

1252
01:07:57,540 --> 01:08:00,040
We need to re-embrace truth.

1253
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:04,460
There has to be a truth again in our society and the closest thing we have to truth is

1254
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:09,900
science and let's do the science, let's do the data around this vaccine.

1255
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:15,500
All this bullshit narrative around the risks, you are much more likely to be killed by your

1256
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:23,660
own dog than have an adverse reaction to results in death from a vaccine.

1257
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:27,620
Vaccines are the best thing to ever happen to us and you know what really frightens me

1258
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:32,420
when I'm hearing from my friends and my cohort?

1259
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:35,220
The following, I'm going to wait.

1260
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:36,840
I'm going to wait.

1261
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:39,100
This is the narcissist playbook.

1262
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:41,180
I'm going to see what the long term effects are.

1263
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:42,860
I'm going to take the vaccine but I'm going to wait.

1264
01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:43,860
Well guess what?

1265
01:08:43,860 --> 01:08:44,860
This isn't about you.

1266
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:46,020
Why?

1267
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:47,020
Why?

1268
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:51,900
If we don't get to herd immunity, we're going to have another 200 million infections at

1269
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:53,340
a 1% mortality rate.

1270
01:08:53,340 --> 01:08:58,180
That means 2 million Americans are going to die and maybe they're browner than you, maybe

1271
01:08:58,180 --> 01:09:02,620
they're heavier than you, maybe they're older than you and you've decided that you really

1272
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:04,900
don't have that bigger risk from COVID-19.

1273
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:05,900
Well guess what?

1274
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:07,660
This isn't fucking about you.

1275
01:09:07,660 --> 01:09:12,660
This is about not being a threat in the web of death that is combing our nation and snaring

1276
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:17,340
vulnerable people because of the asymptomatic carriers who have no effects from this.

1277
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:18,900
I'm going to wait.

1278
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:25,900
In 1940, in May of 1940, there were 400,000 Belgian, French, Dutch and British troops

1279
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:31,180
who were driven to the shores of Dunkirk and had no way out.

1280
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:32,180
They were trapped.

1281
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:34,820
It was going to be a turkey shoot.

1282
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:40,220
And the call went out to Britain that they needed to get these 400,000 men off the beach

1283
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:45,940
and anyone with a sailboat, a fishing boat, anything that floated didn't think, well,

1284
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:48,300
I'm going to weigh the risks.

1285
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:50,340
They didn't know if there was Messerschmitts out there.

1286
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:51,740
They didn't know if there were U-boats.

1287
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:54,540
They didn't know if they were going to drown in bad weather.

1288
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:59,420
They heard the call and they answered it and they saved 400,000 people.

1289
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:04,180
There are 2 million of our American brothers and sisters on a beach right now that are

1290
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:08,180
going to die unless we answer the call.

1291
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:11,660
And the call is to get a vaccine.

1292
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:13,140
Hear the call.

1293
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:16,260
Have any of us had to answer a call to be patriots?

1294
01:10:16,260 --> 01:10:21,260
There are so few of us, including myself, who have done almost nothing in exchange for

1295
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:24,220
the liberties and the prosperity we've enjoyed.

1296
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:25,700
Be that person.

1297
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:26,700
Answer the call.

1298
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:27,860
This isn't about you.

1299
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:30,340
This is about our brothers and sisters who are vulnerable.

1300
01:10:30,340 --> 01:10:34,820
Let's get them off the beach.

1301
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:35,820
My name is Scott Galloway.

1302
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:38,900
I teach at NYU and I appreciate your time.

1303
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:56,780
Our goal is to make you more successful professionally and personally.

1304
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:12,820
If you can attract the right people, things will be better.

1305
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:38,140
It's usually work out.

1306
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:42,860
Companies with recurring revenue relationships tend to outperform and build stakeholder value

1307
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:44,260
faster.

1308
01:11:44,260 --> 01:11:48,420
Gross margin is the accountant's proof or source of truth around differentiation.

1309
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:11,100
Best in class firms are constantly evaluating their competitors to identify substitutes

1310
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:13,900
at all four levels.

1311
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:17,700
Innovation should always be about papering over the gap between what you're able to

1312
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:22,260
provide or what the market's able to provide and what customers actually want.

1313
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:25,900
As you introduce more and more product features, you should be consistently evaluating the

1314
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:28,900
user experience for friction and pain points.

1315
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:55,420
There are many ways to leverage brand to increase perceived value and stakeholder value.

1316
01:12:55,420 --> 01:12:59,180
The basic rule here on crisis management is pretty simple.

1317
