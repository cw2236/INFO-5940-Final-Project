1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,440
Today, our predictions for 2021. First, a disclosure. We get this wrong all the time.

2
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:23,360
By the way, it's we when we get it wrong, it's I when we nail it. As Eisenhower said,

3
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:29,880
plans are useless, however planning is invaluable. The meta trend driving our analysis this year

4
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:36,560
is the great dispersion. The core value a company offers is being dispersed directly to end

5
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:41,960
consumers and skipping the traditional channels of distribution, be they stores, movie theaters,

6
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,920
doctors' offices or banks. The past 50 years of business have been defined by globalization

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,000
followed by digitization. What will define the next decade in business? Dispersion. One

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,840
of the first and biggest tidal waves of dispersion inspired by the pandemic is the dispersion

9
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,680
of headquarters. By the way, if you want to take a cruise down denial, get someone

10
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,160
who owns an office building and someone who owns a movie theater in the same room. First

11
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:14,660
prediction, we're going to see a dramatic evolution in how and where we work. Most people

12
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:18,560
are still working from home and if they return to the office, they're going to be used to

13
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,300
the flexibility of staying at home. And who could catch and ride this tidal wave of change?

14
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:31,020
Some hints. This firm already has 7 million listings in 220 countries, global brand equity

15
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:37,260
and nearly every young executive has an account on this platform. Prediction, Airbnb will

16
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:42,340
repurpose commercial real estate and sell flexible office space to enterprise clients,

17
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:48,540
possibly as a recurring revenue bundle in 2021. While I was to put it mildly, a bear

18
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:54,760
on we work, I'm bullish on the underlying concept. However, following the pandemic,

19
00:01:54,760 --> 00:02:00,600
it's the we and we work that people want to avoid. This change will structurally destroy

20
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,720
demand across full-time office leases in big cities. For example, San Francisco in just

21
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,980
12 months, San Francisco registered its lowest and highest commercial vacancy rate ever.

22
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:17,920
That's right. In one 12 month period, the highest and lowest vacancy rates. If commercial

23
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,040
real estate is a $12 trillion asset class and we see a destruction and gross demand

24
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:30,100
of 10 to 30 percent, where would this capital flow to? Simple, to our homes or residential

25
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:35,480
real estate. Lumber and residential real estate have hit all time highs and we're just getting

26
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:41,400
started. Until this pandemic, we spent 17 percent of our budget on transportation. We'll

27
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:47,760
likely put that capital into the home. That stained rug that you barely noticed has become

28
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,760
unbearable. Prediction, restoration hardware stock doubles in value as does Sonos. There

29
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:59,240
are a few great brands in the home and these two are positioned to catch the tidal wave

30
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:07,080
of capital that will flow into our residences. Another prediction, Apple acquires Peloton.

31
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,140
There has never been a brand that better fits to another brand than Peloton does to Apple.

32
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:16,000
Similar to peanut butter and chocolate, good on their own, but awesome together. By the

33
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:22,520
way, I love candy. I remember a time when you could walk into a gas station with a quarter

34
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:27,080
and leave with a candy bar and a Coke. Now there's cameras everywhere. Anyway, there's

35
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:32,840
a dispersion of the industrial sweat complex to the home. Simply put, gyms are dying and

36
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,600
going to lose somewhere between 10 to 30 percent of their value. Where's it going? Into your

37
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:43,640
garage. Sales of at-home fitness equipment have surged. It's better to be lucky than

38
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:49,440
good and Peloton is both. A connected fitness firm has Apple-like margins and a market cap

39
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:56,440
of $30 billion. Is Peloton worth $30 billion? I don't know. Is it worth more than $30 billion

40
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:02,600
to Apple? Yes. Apple has the capital to pull this off and will do so to get more and more

41
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:08,040
of the all-important attention graph across the wealthiest cohort in America, fitness-obsessed

42
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,480
Americans. This would be a baller move and increase anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes a

43
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:19,620
day the amount of time you are staring at iOS. That number today is more than two and

44
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:25,880
a half hours per day for most Americans. So if a $2 trillion firm can increase their share

45
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:32,120
of the attention graph by 25 percent across an exceptionally attractive cohort amongst

46
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:38,080
its 1 billion strong customer base, what is that worth? Simply put, more than $30 billion.

47
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:44,640
There's also also been a dispersion of retail. First, retail went to warehouses, then to

48
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:50,840
your doorstep. Now it's moving to our phones. Prediction? Look to Shopify to make a big

49
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:57,800
acquisition or big acquisitions in 2021. Shopify was up more in 2020 than in the preceding

50
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:03,800
four years. Flushed with a fully valued currency, we expect to see the Canadian company make

51
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,440
an enormous acquisition in 2021.

52
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:18,680
I am less bullish on Zoom. We believe Zoom will either acquire or merge with a big company in

53
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:26,680
2021. And a bit of a passive aggressive prediction, Zoom will be the AOL of the COVID era.

54
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,640
That's America Online for anyone younger than 30 watching this video. Many believe Zoom is the

55
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:38,280
great white shark of remote. However, however, there are likely other apex predators, specifically

56
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,880
orcas, in the water. Microsoft could double down on Skype or go consumer with Teams. Salesforce

57
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:49,480
could expand Slack with a consumer-oriented product that leads with video. Or any of the four

58
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:54,760
could push their existing video communication capabilities. In short, they will featurize

59
00:05:54,760 --> 00:06:02,920
video and eat Zoom's lunch. Look out below. We believe Zoom is vulnerable and it's $113 billion

60
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:08,040
market capitalization inflated. Unlike its competitors, Zoom doesn't have an enterprise

61
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:13,960
mode. Zoom either has to buy its way out of this or sell. I predict Zoom will recognize this and

62
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:21,080
try to merge with a traditional big EBITDA company. Prediction? That merger will likely go down as one

63
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:28,200
of the worst in history, perhaps securing second place behind the original AOL-Time Warner merger.

64
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:34,680
What would be an interesting acquisition or merger? Zoom and WhatsApp, recently spun by Facebook

65
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:41,640
after they are found guilty of monopoly abuse and forced as a remedy to break up or divest WhatsApp

66
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:46,520
and Instagram. Which, by the way, brings us to another form of dispersion. Breakups, courtesy of

67
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,640
the energized state and federal antitrust authorities. Prediction? In the face of antitrust,

68
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:59,480
Facebook stock increases and Amazon prophylactically spins AWS, which will be the most valuable company

69
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:05,320
in the world by 2025. You can find a link to many of our thoughts on this in the description,

70
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:11,880
but simply put, every stakeholder except the sociopath running the firm benefits in a breakup.

71
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,720
By the way, to hear more about the great dispersion of money and our predictions

72
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:21,320
regarding Bitcoin, tune in next week. And finally, as we mentioned before, the greatest

73
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:26,920
fields of dispersion will be in healthcare and education. Combined with headquarters and banks,

74
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,920
we're looking at a reshuffling of a quarter of our economy.

75
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:41,080
Now, we want to take a moment to look back on the shitshow of 2020 and acknowledge the individual

76
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,720
who emerged as our Person of the Year. This isn't a joke. We've thought a lot about this.

77
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:55,160
ProffG's 2020 Person of the Year is the founder of Amazon, who has inspired all of us here at

78
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:01,320
ProffG. Specifically, you heard that right, our Person of the Year is Mackenzie Scott.

79
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:06,520
Mackenzie Scott, the unacknowledged co-founder of Amazon that doesn't get the credit for her

80
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:12,920
early contributions to the retail behemoth. In a Medium post published in December 2020,

81
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:20,600
Scott announced she'd given away $4.2 billion in the past four months to nearly 400 organizations.

82
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:27,240
That's on top of $1.7 billion in gifts earlier in July. While Jeff is having the mother of all

83
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:34,760
midlife crises chasing silicone and Botox, Mackenzie is giving billions to local YMCAs across

84
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:41,480
the country. By the way, the best revenge, the best revenge is to live a wonderful life. In our

85
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:48,200
sense is that Miss Scott is living hers. She didn't hamstring her gifts with RFPs, naming rights,

86
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,160
or phone calls to the admissions director to advocate for her doubles partner's impressive

87
00:08:53,160 --> 00:09:00,040
son. Scott took a data-driven approach to giving. She started with 6,400 potential organizations.

88
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,400
Then her team evaluated their leadership and the results with special attention to those operating

89
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:12,360
in communities facing inequity and poor access to philanthropic capital. Miss Scott is not just more

90
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:18,360
generous than her co-founder, she's smarter. Scott is one of the few beneficiaries of the pandemic

91
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:24,760
to acknowledge this ugly truth. The wealthy have accrued massive incremental wealth during a crisis

92
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:30,440
that has devastated so many. There are many of us, and we don't like to say this out loud,

93
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:37,720
who are living our best lives. For much of the top 10%, the pandemic has meant some inconvenience,

94
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:44,120
but substantially more time with loved ones, more time with Netflix, and our stock portfolios have

95
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:52,760
never been stronger. What is America? Is it a set of beliefs that we cement, hopefully with actions?

96
00:09:53,400 --> 00:10:00,200
Are we the most innovative culture on earth? No. Are we the most powerful? Doesn't appear so.

97
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:06,280
An economy a twelfth of our size has infiltrated our federal agencies and a virus one four hundredth

98
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:12,360
the width of a human hair has laid bare our comorbidities, our arrogance, our weakness.

99
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:19,880
However, however, Miss Scott gives us hope that we are still a nation of people who recognize

100
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:26,840
their blessings and pursue not just prosperity, but progress. We take some comfort from Scott's

101
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:35,160
actions that America, for all its faults, still strives to be a culture of generosity and empathy.

102
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:48,120
We'll see you next week.
