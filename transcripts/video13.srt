1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
I think Vice President Harris is going to win the election.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,440
I think there's a few things that will

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,880
carry her across the finish line.

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,960
When I look at the attributes of,

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,840
I don't know if they'll be sexist girls,

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,120
they're more organized.

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,520
They are.

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,040
They are a little bit more meticulous.

9
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,000
And I think when it comes to election day,

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,560
I think a lot of young women are going

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,880
to find a way to schedule time and get to the booth.

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,680
Young men, just bottom line, as someone

13
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,920
who's raising young men, I affectionately call them dopes.

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,160
Their prefrontal cortex does not catch up until the age of 25.

15
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,480
Yeah, they're not voting, right?

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,320
Because they're too young.

17
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,160
That would be illegal.

18
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,960
Well, yeah, at 117, I asked him, who would you vote for?

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,480
And he goes, well, I'd vote for Harris

20
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,240
because you're voting for her.

21
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,000
And I'm like, I hate and love that answer.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,840
Anyways, but my point is, I think women are motivated.

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,280
Quite frankly, they're more organized.

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,040
Young women are going to do better at showing up

25
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:56,960
on election day.

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,440
I'd like to think that young men are getting the message

27
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,520
around a need to protect.

28
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,480
Or I'd like to think that that's a theme

29
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,120
that's resonating here, that they do see that there

30
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,840
is a certain level of demonization and attack

31
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,840
for special interest groups.

32
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,120
And I'd like to think they're stepping up.

33
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,240
And three, and again, this might be confirmation bias.

34
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,800
I'm just too emotional here.

35
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,600
But I think this self-inflicted, unforced error

36
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,520
around Puerto Rico with 400,000 to 500,000 Puerto Ricans

37
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,560
in Pennsylvania could be very, very, could.
