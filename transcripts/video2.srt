00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
Welcome to the stage, optimist, author, and founder of The Curve, Simon Sinek.

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:07,840
Yes.

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,640
Thank you. Thank you very much. So obviously you're all here for Scott Galloway.

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,480
Scott is one of those people who pushes you to see the world differently. It's one of the reasons I

5
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:33,040
love him and love his work. He also puts himself out there in a way that I think very, very

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:40,320
few others can or want to. He's so vulnerable and shares with us the struggles that he's going

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,960
through that we can relate to. But more important, his views on the world, his perspective on how it

8
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,880
works are different than everybody else, which is why we have to listen to Scott. He doesn't

9
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:57,600
always get his predictions right, but we have to listen. Ladies and gentlemen, Scott Galloway.

10
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:08,240
Thank you. My name is Scott Galloway. I teach at NYU. I have 147 slides and

11
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,560
2,400 seconds, so let's light this candle. So in the spirit of transparency,

12
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,520
I don't know Simon that well. I don't like him very much, but it's a power move to have him

13
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:29,680
introduce me. Okay, so I got home pretty late last night and decided to reorient the slides.

14
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,920
I'd fiddle with the slides up until the time I present them. And I thought given that we're

15
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,840
on a cruise ship and I met a lot of people last night who are in the business of travel,

16
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,880
that we would try and talk about travel. I'll make some predictions around tech. It's kind of

17
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,360
around the world tour. It's basically whatever I just wanted to talk about tonight. And then

18
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,280
hopefully we'll leave some time for my favorite part, Q&A. We have a pretty intimate crowd here

19
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,000
tonight, so I'm going to try and leave some time for Q&A. Okay, we're going to talk about the

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,760
economy, travel, transportation, what else, AI, because we didn't get enough of that today,

21
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,280
income inequality. I'm worried about the shit I've created after I've made tens of millions of dollars.

22
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:17,120
But I'm Dr. Frankenstein and I think Frank might have some violent tendencies. I'm concerned. Yeah,

23
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,680
fuck you, figure out what we do. I'm going to talk about loneliness.

24
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,000
And then I'm going to try and wrap up with quote unquote some perspective.

25
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,120
So if you weren't reading every day that we were about to have a recession,

26
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,200
where would the evidence of any recession be? I think that inflation is going to come down

27
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,840
as quickly as it went up. AI, the rider's strike, which will end in tears for the riders.

28
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,680
For the first time, people are not as confident negotiating pep bereavement leave in the growth

29
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,200
economy. I think you're about to see wage pressure come way down and you're about to see inflation

30
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:04,160
come way down back to historic or more normal levels. And I'm not sure. I studied economics,

31
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:11,440
but I don't consider myself an economist, but I don't see any signs of a recession. As I said,

32
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:18,880
inflation is coming way down. Unemployment is at historic lows. Now, some people would argue,

33
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:24,160
well, there's discouraged workers. You have the wrong denominator here, but we essentially have

34
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,680
historically low unemployment. Retail sales are strong. We've ripped through about four of the

35
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,920
five trillion dollars we handed out during the pandemic and we're ripping through another

36
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,400
hundred billion a month. So there is some credence to the argument. I'm sorry, I'm so stand over here

37
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,720
that in about 10 months, people are going to run out of money. But right now it doesn't appear

38
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,400
unless you were looking at the media that you'd see any real signals that we're going into a

39
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,680
recession. All of a sudden, we're starting to see people talk about earnings calls or in earnings

40
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,800
calls, use the term soft landing as opposed to recession. They're even starting to soften their

41
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:05,280
tone. There's an effect that when you worry about something or the moment you really begin to start

42
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,160
worrying about something, the odds of it happening go way down. It's the shit you don't see coming

43
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:15,120
that gets you. None of us really saw the pandemic coming. Remember Greek sovereign debt that was

44
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,440
supposedly going to collapse and take down all of Europe or that all elevators were going to start

45
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,600
stop working New Year's 2000. It's a general survival instinct that if you worry about something

46
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,680
long enough, you unconsciously prepare for it and you avoid it. So we have been talking so much about

47
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,760
the recession that I wonder if we're probably not going to it's not going to register.

48
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,640
Where we are seeing a recession is what I call the Patagonia Vest recession.

49
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,560
I have two entries. I'm credited with two entries in the urban dictionary. The first is Yoga Babel,

50
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:57,120
which is how I described the WeWork prospectus. And then I just got my second one and that is the

51
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:04,240
Patagonia Vest recession. And that is the growth economy has had so many calories stepped down.

52
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:10,720
It's esophagus that it's built up fatty deposits everywhere. And if you understand balance sheet

53
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,840
economics, essentially if you have gross margins of 20%, which is great gross margins or operating

54
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:22,160
margins, excuse me, of 20%, you can either add $5 a new income of new revenue to your company,

55
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,960
or you can cut a dollar of expenses and you have the same net effect on shareholder value.

56
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,760
So the most actionable or significant on the ground impact or strategy of 2023 is an AI. It

57
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:39,760
is a supply chain. It's everybody in every boardroom has seen what Elon Musk has done.

58
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:46,240
Specifically, he's fired 80% of his staff. He's taken the staff down from 7,500 people to 1800.

59
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,440
He's going to 1000. And there really isn't from the consumer end any discernible impact on the

60
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:57,440
product. Now, he's lost about 80% of us or 60 to 80% of his advertising revenue, but people would

61
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,720
argue that's a self-inflicted wound. So in every board, people are asking themselves, how do we

62
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:09,760
have the great taste of reduced costs without the calories of losing revenue? So the business

63
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:15,440
strategy circulating the majority of the growth economy is could we lay off 10, 20, 30% of our

64
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,120
employees, but manage to hold on to the majority of our revenues? That is the easiest way to add

65
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,400
shareholder value and the markets like it every time a company announces layoffs, the stock goes

66
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,120
up. The majority of people in this room have never really seen that type of economy before. When I

67
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,400
graduated from business school, 40% of my class had a job. So in other words, 60% two thirds of

68
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,600
the class did not have a single job. My kids now, when I say kids, I mean my students on average

69
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:47,760
have between three and five job offers out of NYU Stern, average salary $212,000. Meaning if someone

70
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,480
goes to work for a nonprofit for a hundredth grand, there's somebody who's accepted a job at

71
00:06:52,480 --> 00:07:01,440
330 or $350,000. That is much different. That is no one ever feels overpaid. The majority of us

72
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:09,840
in this room right now are overpaid. Oh, I do have sound. If in the back of you can hear this video,

73
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,000
this video does have sound. This is one of my favorite videos to kind of summarize

74
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,760
the growth economy.

75
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,560
Can you imagine the fight over who would get to fire this person?

76
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:08,320
I had 300 kids in my class, about 30 to 40 of them go to work for Amazon, about 20 Google,

77
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:13,920
literally big tech was coming in every year and hoovering up all human capital. It was a fight.

78
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:19,120
Every manager's job usually at the end of the year and I run growth companies is how do we keep the

79
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:26,320
young people happy, right? It was just a constant question. How do we keep people with us? How do

80
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:33,600
we attract new people? That has flipped. And I love these TikToks now of people getting fired that day.

81
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:39,440
Okay. And my first piece of advice, because I don't think many of you have been fired before,

82
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:45,680
I've been fired from every job I've ever had. And it's not about you. It's not a personal,

83
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,640
it's not a statement on your character. It's not about the condition of your soul. It's usually

84
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,440
about things outside of your control. And I think the tech community and the labor force was lying

85
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,600
to you when they said, bring your full self to work. Don't bring your politics to work. No one

86
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,640
gives a shit about your politics. Corporations are a platform to build economic security for

87
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,480
you and your family. And they might have pretended that they cared, but they don't. And so don't think

88
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,040
that when you get fired or laid off, it's an assessment on you. No, it's not. It's about

89
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,800
what's happening at the time in the economy. Almost always. You got to put these layoffs in

90
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:27,680
context though. They make for great headlines. Huge headlines. Amazon meta lays off 8,000 people

91
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,480
from page, but this is how many people they've hired since the beginning of the pandemic.

92
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,880
So all these quote unquote mass firings are just taking them back to employment levels of 12 or 18

93
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,560
months ago. This is still just a fraction of the people that human capital that they have brought

94
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:51,520
into their organizations in the last 36 months. The layoffs here, despite all the headlines

95
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:57,120
represent about 1% of norm farm payroll employment. We're obsessed with big tech,

96
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,360
but as it relates to the economy in terms of market capitalization, it's big, but as employment,

97
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:09,520
it actually doesn't employ that many people. 2023, the year of experiences. So if you looked at most

98
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:14,560
things, most structural trends, whether it's e-commerce, even teen depression, and you did

99
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,120
know the pandemic had happened and it just maintained its current slope. Teen depression

100
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,240
has been going up steadily since the introduction of social on mobile. E-commerce has been growing

101
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,720
high single low double digits per year. They've all kind of returned to where they would have been

102
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:34,320
around the pandemic. The only thing that appears to be the enduring change is work from home. That

103
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,520
appears to be very, very sticky. That's kind of the enduring change coming out of COVID, where if

104
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,200
someone showed up and said, how is the world different? How do we know something happened here?

105
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:49,120
It would be remote work and the really disappointing work or the gene twang and

106
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,400
Jonathan Hyde just came out with is that we've been blaming depression of kids on COVID.

107
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,920
And the reality is if you look at the trends of teen depression, what they found is it wasn't

108
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:06,800
COVID. It was social media that was doing it. In some, social distancing didn't create depression

109
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:14,080
among teens. Social media did. Ton of revenge travel, right? One of the wonderful things about

110
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,240
coming out of COVID is people seem to have a renewed sense of what's important, the finite

111
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:25,040
nature of life and people are going big in terms of travel. Travel sites traffic up dramatically.

112
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,040
New record for passports that have been issued in the United States.

113
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:35,360
China's returning to the tourism market. So that's new wind in the sails and people are

114
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:43,600
spending a greater proportion of their disposable income on travel. And then we're seeing huge

115
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,440
demand returning. For the most part, the travel industry is taking advantage of this and using

116
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:55,040
COVID as an excuse not to restore previous service levels. I get to stay in very nice places, mostly

117
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,280
because someone else is paying and the way I would describe luxury travel right now is six star prices

118
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:04,880
with four star service. And as a result, their margins have never been bigger. They're making

119
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,000
up for the revenues that they were that they lost through COVID. It's a great time to be in the travel

120
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:17,360
business. Live entertainment is surging. People want to be around each other, which is a wonderful

121
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:26,240
thing. And also people have a renewed sense of the value of time versus money. Okay, so

122
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,800
everything in its own way is retail. And I would argue that the worst retail experiences are

123
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,480
grocery stores, airports and gas stations. Tesla didn't disrupt the auto industry, it disrupted

124
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:43,120
the gas station. If you spend 15 minutes a week in a gas station, that's 12 and a half hours a year

125
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,480
pulling in smelling those carcinogens, worrying about getting shot. That is literally the worst

126
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:55,600
retail experience in America. How much would someone have to pay you to get up at six, get to

127
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,360
the gas station at seven in the morning, fill up, drive around the block and do that until seven

128
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:08,000
thirty at night? You would probably pay a lot of money to avoid that. In addition, this industry

129
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,040
was so disruptible, mostly because of charging stations or mostly because of the gas stations.

130
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,440
I think disruption is more a function of how ripe an industry is to be disrupted as opposed to the

131
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,360
disrupting technology. It wasn't immediately obvious that Google was going to disrupt the

132
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,400
advertising industry, but the advertising industry had basically said, we're going to triple our

133
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:32,400
costs every 10 years, even despite the fact that our audiences are shrinking, more expensive for

134
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:38,160
less reach. And it stuck out its chin. Grocery stores and department stores really hadn't changed

135
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:44,240
in about 30 or 40 years. And the fist of stone of Amazon came forward. Ad-supported cable television

136
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:50,080
got worse and worse, but more and more expensive. And so Netflix came in at 12 bucks a month and

137
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:56,320
disrupted that industry. So the question then becomes what industry is most ripe for disruption?

138
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:02,320
AI is clearly the technology, right? But more important than the technology is what industry

139
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,960
has an enormous chin sticking out right now? And I'll come back and try and answer that.

140
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,600
Lines, we spend a lot of time in lines. I think that essentially if you want to build a company

141
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,400
that's worth over a hundred billion dollars, you've got to build a time machine. If you just let your

142
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:23,760
kids watch Netflix and not broadcast television, that kid say it's 12 days a year in commercials.

143
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:30,640
Amazon has given you six days back at a spending time in department stores and grocery stores.

144
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:35,520
The majority of companies that get past a hundred billion have effectively built time machines.

145
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:43,360
I love the company clear. I'm obsessed with trying to expedite everything in terms of time. You get

146
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:49,120
that way as you get older. And most of these high-end luxury items are pretty much focused on saving time.

147
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,560
Peter Drucker, who's sort of my role model, an economist in the 60s,

148
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,920
basically said that every major business trend can be predicted by demographics.

149
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,320
And if you were to try and find a demographic trend that's going to wag the tail, that it's a good

150
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,520
thing to get behind. And I did get behind this in 2010. I started a company doing business

151
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:13,920
intelligence and analytics for luxury brands. Because what I saw was that income inequality was

152
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,720
about to become income insanity. And history repeats itself. Essentially you have an economy

153
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,680
that starts off as a collective. Everybody wants to help each other. Wealthy people weaponize

154
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,000
government, become more productive, leverage technology, and slowly but surely figure out a

155
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,120
way to lower their taxes and figure out a way to engage in massive tax avoidance to create more and

156
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,680
more power. And we'll wring their hands and be very concerned about what's going on. And the next

157
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:43,680
year the tax rate goes down. And eventually there's a revolution and it starts all over again.

158
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,000
But we're at a point right now where it's literally gone parabolic. And you've seen all these all this

159
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,200
data about the 0.1 percent. But if I were to say to people constantly come and say what industry

160
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:58,000
would you be in? I'm like, if I were you just going to any industry serving the 0.1 percent.

161
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,080
Because the amount of disposable income there, it's like that very basic adage that people used to

162
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:08,960
tell young professionals, get as close to the biggest pile of money. Stand as close as you can

163
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:13,520
to the biggest pile of money and everything will work out. And that pile of money is increasingly

164
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:20,080
accreting to fewer and fewer people. So social clubs, the 1 percent is now sequestering from

165
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:25,840
everybody else, right? We allow visitors in based on being super interesting or super hot as tourists.

166
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,720
We give them a day pass. But mostly we've decided we no longer want to hang out with the other 99

167
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:37,840
percent, even when we're socializing. Anyone done one of these private tours at Disney? Disney just

168
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:44,400
announced pretty terrible earnings, but they were saved by one thing, the parks. What they didn't

169
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:52,640
publish was the thing driving a ton of incremental spend there is these private VIP tours where you

170
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,320
pay somewhere between I think seven and nine hundred bucks an hour, a minimum of five hours.

171
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,920
So for about five to seven grand, you and five friends get to cut the line. I did this for the

172
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:07,040
first time last year and it's physically uncomfortable when you get to the Avatar ride

173
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:13,920
and they could hand out an iPad when you get in the line and you could watch Avatar before you

174
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:20,880
actually get on the ride. The wait time is three hours if you only paid 160 bucks. But if you paid

175
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:27,280
7,000, you and your kids get to cut the line. It's about three minutes and they give you a hand

176
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:33,440
signal in case you want to go on it a second or a third time. And this is the fastest growing part

177
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:39,920
of the parks business. Think about the profits there. A very high EQ, really nice, you know,

178
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:47,280
young man from Kansas shows you around, takes you on a golf cart behind the bowels of the three parks

179
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,800
so you can go on the two or three best rides at each of the three parks.

180
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,880
It's getting worse and most of you have probably seen this on TikTok,

181
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,160
but this is right, this is where this is socialism, right? You start off thinking everyone

182
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,200
should be equal. It doesn't work, right? People engage in their own self-interest. It's a,

183
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,280
that's what capitalism is. It taps into one of the most powerful motivators and that is our

184
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:20,560
own self-interest. What we want, most people agree that the most productive, hardest-working

185
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:25,600
people should make more money. And then it's just gone absolutely insane. People really don't

186
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,800
recognize just how insane it's gotten. And by the way, wealthy people usually don't talk about money

187
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:35,840
because they don't, they see it as uncouth, which is really nothing but an attempt to keep poor

188
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,240
people down by ensuring they don't know how much money they actually are making and have relative

189
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,760
to them. So they've created this social dogma around talking about money. I think everyone

190
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,240
should talk about how much money they make. I think it's healthy because you're going to find

191
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:56,080
out just how outrageous it is about how some people at a certain level in your company or in

192
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:02,160
society, how much money they're making. So for every hundred dollars created in the past 10 years,

193
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:09,440
54 bucks went to the top 1%. That's globally. It's actually much worse than that in G7 nations and

194
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:17,120
even much worse in the U.S. 70 cents of it went to the bottom half. So $100, an incremental value

195
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,360
created over the last 10 years, 70 cents of it went to the bottom half.

196
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:29,280
It used to take 26 billionaires to equal the bottom half of America. Now it takes, excuse me,

197
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:34,400
used to take 380 billionaires. Now it takes 26. By the end of next year, there's probably going to

198
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,640
be three people in the United States that are worth more than the bottom half of America.

199
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:45,120
That's the bad news. The good news is that incremental quality is usually self-correcting.

200
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,920
More bad news is the means of self-correction are usually war, famine, or revolution.

201
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,360
Don't you find it unusual that all of these rich people have their go-bags and their bunkers in New

202
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:04,400
Zealand or in Sonoma? I find it so nihilistic and disappointing that the wealthiest, most resource,

203
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,440
and arguably the most intelligent among us decide to devote their resources to colonizing other

204
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,000
planets or taking us into another universe as opposed to just trying to make this place a

205
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:28,640
little bit more fucking habitable. This is the wealthy weaponizing government. These are tax rates.

206
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:35,120
These are tax rates. The greatest innovation in history wasn't the iPhone, wasn't chips,

207
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:41,040
it was the middle class. And that is we had 7 million men coming back from war and we decided

208
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:46,160
to give them money to buy houses and give them jobs, $500 billion infrastructure act,

209
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:50,240
and that made them more attractive to potential mates and we had the baby boom.

210
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:58,080
The tax rate on the top 1% in 1945 was 92% because to sustain the middle class,

211
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:03,520
the greatest innovation in history, took a lot of money. And so we recognized that if we wanted

212
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,160
a really progressive tax structure, we would have to tax people at a higher rate. And in the

213
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,000
spirit of transparency, just to give you a sense of how ridiculous things have gotten,

214
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:18,080
I buy or I start companies, I got very lucky, I sold one of my companies a few years ago. The

215
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:24,560
first $10 million to me, the founder, were tax free. I've invested in another company,

216
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:30,480
I invested $2.5 million in another company that just got purchased. The first $25 million to me,

217
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:37,040
because of QSB, will be tax free. Zero tax rate on the first $10 million when you're an entrepreneur

218
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,480
or when you make a large capital investment in a small company. And people will say,

219
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:48,400
well, okay, but you're a productive citizen. You wouldn't start companies unless you have

220
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,880
these tax breaks. No entrepreneur knows the tax rates when they start a business.

221
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:01,200
My effective tax rate for the last decade has been 17%. That's my effective tax rate,

222
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,760
and I'm very public about that. And there's another myth, and that is that lower and middle

223
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,840
income people are paying all the taxes. Actually, they're not. They pay a lot in consumption and

224
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:15,680
sales tax, but they actually pay very little federal income tax. The people who get most

225
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:22,000
screwed by our tax code are what I refer to as the workhorses. And that is they make between

226
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,560
$150,000 and a million a year. And it's all reportable. It's all current income. And they

227
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:32,560
usually, in order to make that kind of money, have to live in an urban center that's usually a blue

228
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,960
state. And they're usually paying an effective tax rate of somewhere between 45% and 50%.

229
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:42,800
And they make enough money to live well. No one feels sorry for them. But until they have enough

230
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:47,680
money to start making investments where they register capital gains, they're paying tax rates

231
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:54,160
of 45% or 50%. Now, if they really start to live large and make a lot of money and can afford to

232
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:59,600
put that money into investments, then they make the jump to light speed. And their tax rate,

233
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:06,080
once they get to about the 99th percentile, starts to plummet. So we've effectively decided

234
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,920
that if you win a gold medal, we're going to take the silver and the bronze and give it to you too.

235
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:17,280
Your tax rate goes parabolic. Once you go over six figures, it keeps going higher and higher until

236
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,720
about a million. And then it absolutely plummets once you get into the top 1%.

237
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,880
Luxury is the best business in the world. Wealthiest man in the world

238
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:39,040
didn't invent a search engine or a social media network. He basically creates artificial scarcity.

239
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,520
He creates desire. Wealthiest man in the world is, of course, Bernard Arnaud. And these three guys

240
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,960
now have wealth greater than the GDP of a bunch of nations. Private flight, private travel,

241
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,040
don't worry what this is up. This is an interesting stat. And the private luxury

242
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:00,640
usually gains in popularity before an economic crash because people become self-conscious about

243
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:07,360
their wealth. I'm obsessed with succession and this kind of defines sort of quiet luxury. No logos,

244
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,920
just very expensive, beautifully crafted things that aren't very flashy.

245
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:16,960
Now you might say, well, where do billionaires come from? The industry that's created the second

246
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,960
most billionaires is actually luxury. Tech has created more.

247
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,520
This is the best business in the world. And that is creating artificial scarcity. And artificial

248
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:34,320
scarcity is essentially the strategy that unfortunately America has adopted.

249
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:40,080
The strongest brands in the world aren't Apple or Mez or Nike. They're MIT. They're

250
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:46,800
Mez or Nike. They're MIT and Stanford and Harvard. And every day me and my colleagues wake up and we

251
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:52,880
ask ourselves one question. How can I increase my compensation while reducing my accountability?

252
00:24:54,160 --> 00:25:01,040
And the way we do that, the way we do that is we've adopted the ultimate strategy.

253
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,240
We target the 0.1% and we adopt this rejectionist, exclusionary luxury positioning. And despite the

254
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:14,400
fact we sit on endowments, again, the size of some Latin American GDPs, we don't expand

255
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:20,960
freshmen seats. So we can take admissions rates and take them way, way down and turn into a

256
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:29,280
Birkenbeck as opposed to public servants. It makes alumni feel good. The value of your degree goes up

257
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:33,600
when it gets harder to get into your institution. The moment you have a house, you start taking an

258
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,800
interest in the local review board and basically come up with thoughtful ways to ensure that new

259
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:45,520
housing never gets built. Meaning that housing has accelerated, housing costs in the US have accelerated

260
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,960
about the same price as a luxury good. Once I have a tech company and it works, I'm going to weaponize

261
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:56,880
government to make sure new companies can't get born. Our entire economy has moved to a luxury

262
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:03,280
artificial scarcity economy where we create artificial scarcity to drive up prices that drive

263
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:09,840
value to the incumbents and the entrenched. This is how I explain it.

264
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,080
For most of history, our species hasn't had access to sugary, salty or fatty foods,

265
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,360
so diabetes, right? Our instincts haven't caught up with industrial production.

266
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:26,640
So if you can create something that feels scarce, if you can convince people that a Panerai watch

267
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:32,000
is scarce, right? They artificially choke supply. So if I see one, I think, oh, I got to buy one

268
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,240
because I want to signal masculinity and strength. I'm dying soon, so I need to signal this type of

269
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:44,880
success, right? And they do a great job of creating art. This is not a difficult thing to produce.

270
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:53,280
It's about 1500 bucks of movement, plastic, glass and leather that they sell for about 12,000 bucks

271
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:58,960
by creating this illusion of scarcity. When there's a scarcity of food, a scarcity of mating

272
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:05,520
opportunities and now a scarcity of luxury items or scarcity of education at an elite university,

273
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,920
you can raise prices faster than inflation and aggregate a great deal of wealth. And this is

274
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:15,840
the only video I could come up with last night to explain it.

275
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:33,520
Three times last night, somebody here, if that gets a plus.

276
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,880
Three times last night, someone offered me mushroom chocolates.

277
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,240
And I don't know if that says something about you or something about me.

278
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,240
The third time I said yes, and I just went back to my room and I watched this video about 80 times.

279
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,920
It was a pretty nice way to spend the night. I opened the window,

280
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,920
kept asking myself, how high am I now?

281
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:12,000
How high am I now? It's really nice. So you're out there and thank you.

282
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,640
It's the ultimate marketing strategy. Create artificial scarcity, right?

283
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,880
And luxury has outperformed every other industry, again, all footing back to a demographic shift,

284
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,320
and that is the point one percent are aggregating more and more wealth.

285
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,800
And you may not feel rich. Every person in this room is probably in the top 10 percent

286
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:44,400
in their G7 economy. And if you make more than $40,000, you're in the top one percent globally

287
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:50,480
in terms of income. Tremendous growth potential. This status blew my mind.

288
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,960
Hermes now has a larger market capitalization than Nike. Can you believe that?

289
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:02,720
Because most companies, if you can create artificial scarcity, you literally create a cash spigot.

290
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,840
And I've worked with all of these companies and I'm talking about, I'm going to do a ton of

291
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,200
name dropping because I'm deeply insecure and desperate for your affirmation.

292
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,680
But essentially, Hermes, go into an Hermes store and say, yeah, I'll take that back.

293
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:24,560
And they're like, oh, sir, that's a three year waiting list. This shit is not hard to make.

294
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:30,560
These bags are not hard to make, but they have done a genius job of creating a sense of artificial

295
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:36,800
scarcity. So as a result, if the CFO walks into the COO's office in Hermes and says,

296
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,640
I need another literally billion dollars in revenue over the next three months.

297
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:48,240
The CEO can do it. No problem. Just produce another, you know, what, a $15,000 average price point

298
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:54,160
bag will produce another 600,000 bags. There's your billion dollars, 80 points of gross margin,

299
00:29:54,160 --> 00:30:00,080
800 million in gross margin, 400 million in EBITDA. And the analysts know that. So they can

300
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:05,280
perfectly predict and calibrate. They make their projections because if they're about to miss their

301
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:10,640
projections, they just turn on the tap. There's very few companies that are able to establish

302
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:16,080
that type of scarcity or create a cash tap where all they need to do is just open or throttle the

303
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:24,640
spigot. So we've gone from luxury to ultra luxury. I love to travel. I don't travel to cities or

304
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,200
countries. I travel to hotels. I find hotels that look great. And that's where I go on vacation.

305
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:35,840
And you have seen basically the Ritz-Carlton, the Four Seasons, which used to be sort of the top

306
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:42,880
luxury brands be bested. They were sort of for the top three or 4%, but now 0.1% brands have come in

307
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:49,040
because that's where a ton of incremental income has happened. So you're seeing hotels

308
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:54,400
where the average price point, the average price point is seven or nine thousand dollars a night

309
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:01,360
and they're full. So you have the Four Seasons, the Mandarin Oriental, and the Ritz-Carlton,

310
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,960
and now you have Cheval and Blanc, Almond, Rosewood.

311
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,840
Six cents have all come in and said no, the opportunity is in the 0.1%.

312
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,280
So a weird prediction, but I'm obsessed with football. You're going to see a massive increase

313
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:23,040
in the value of sports teams over the next 10 years. One, because we keep, as long as we're

314
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:28,400
producing more and more billionaires who happen to be in the midst of the midlife crisis, you're

315
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:35,120
going to see a massive increase in the value of these teams. And you're seeing it now. You're

316
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:42,880
seeing an acceleration in the value of sports teams. One, they actually benefit from some

317
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:50,160
secular trends or structural trends. They're the only content that doesn't look to be disrupted by.

318
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:55,760
It's the only content we watch live now that advertising still works and it also taps into

319
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:01,440
people's emotions. You also have an entire region, the Gulf, that has decided, okay,

320
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:07,920
we need to improve our image. We have to pivot to a non-fossil fuels based economy. We have

321
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:12,880
30 to 50 years to do that. We have infinite capital. So how do we do that? How do we create

322
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,280
a perception such that the most talented people in the world want to come work, live,

323
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,880
and be educated here? We have to upgrade our image. There's a smart people they figured out,

324
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,960
unlimited resources. So they used to advertise on Bloomberg and CNN and say,

325
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:33,360
invest in Malaysia, Qatar, a great place to live. And what they figured out is if they buy a football

326
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:39,600
team, they get some of that positive brand imagery and they'll probably break even on a cash flow

327
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:45,520
basis, maybe lose some money. And then in 10, 20 or 30 years, the asset has increased in terminal

328
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:51,840
value. So this is the ultimate brand ROI expenditure if you're trying to upgrade the perception

329
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:57,680
of a country. So we're going to start to see the Gulf nations come into every league, buy leagues,

330
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:03,200
buy teams, because it's as if they could run a commercial. But then in 10 years,

331
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,760
they get three times the cost of the commercial back.

332
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:14,560
It's also a fantastic way to cross over celebrity, media, and the value of these things. I would

333
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:19,680
imagine that Ryan Reynolds and Rob are probably going to make five to 10 X on their investment,

334
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:30,480
just over 24 months on Wrexham. A little awkward being on his boat.

335
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:38,880
It's the bottom line. Billionaires as they, billionaire Republicans as they realize they're

336
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,840
not going to live forever, start buying football teams and billionaire Democrats by media companies.

337
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:49,120
This is kind of the ultimate expression of like you haven't wrapped your head around death yet.

338
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:56,800
I just like the slide.

339
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,200
And I'm here to announce that at some point, if I have another 30 or 40 exits, I'm going to buy

340
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:12,640
Rangers FC in Glasgow. I'm going to take my boys. I'm going to be really into the community,

341
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,240
and they will love me.

342
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:24,400
Okay. So the values of these sports teams is already accelerating. There's going to be investor

343
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:30,160
groups, SPACs. This is going to be kind of the new accelerating luxury item. You're going to see all

344
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:35,440
sorts of new investment opportunities. Someone enterprising will put together a DAO and start

345
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:41,440
buying teams and people like us will have the opportunity to participate. And then I think

346
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,720
you're especially going to see it in football. Again, I'm biased here, but I think that this league

347
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:51,280
or these teams appear to be global brands. I think they're going to accelerate faster than

348
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:58,880
any other global brands. You're going to start hearing terms like Arsenal and Inter Milan

349
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,680
that you didn't hear before or that most people didn't hear before. These brands are going global.

350
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,520
This is a shocker. I'm really going on a limb here.

351
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:15,440
I said this a year ago. I have this kind of secret weapon for figuring out if the technology is enduring.

352
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:22,720
And that is I look at the amount of citations in academic journals. And typically what you have

353
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:29,040
is in academia, the whole academic research is really, it's a wonderful thing. It sounds

354
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,480
very basic, but it's really a wonderful thing. And that is you put out, you publish something

355
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,960
and say, well, I think I'm onto something about AI. And you publish it and you publish your

356
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:42,080
theses and your research. And then someone, a colleague from Carnegie Mellon or Tulane says,

357
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:45,280
this is what you got right. And this is what you got wrong. And I'm going to refute it. And if they

358
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,840
can refute it, we actually celebrate them as long as they add value to it. And we congratulate them.

359
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:54,640
We don't start shit posting each other on Twitter. We say, okay, what you're saying is right. You've

360
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:00,000
made my research better. And we have an enduring build of intellectual property that ideally then

361
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,840
floats into the private sector. And as you can see in mobile and GPS, that build was slow and steady.

362
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:09,760
And I would argue the mobile and GPS are probably the most enduring technology

363
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:16,240
of the last 30 years. Now, in contrast, let's look at the academic research and citations

364
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:24,880
of the metaverse and crypto. Right. Me and my colleagues, oh, the metaverse is hot.

365
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:33,520
Right. Oh, crypto, it's hot. Right. And then this is what happens. It just dies.

366
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:44,000
Look at the curve in artificial intelligence. It's very similar to the curve of mobile and GPS.

367
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:50,720
And I can't find any other technology that has the same citations or the same curve

368
00:36:52,560 --> 00:37:00,480
of this, the most enduring technology other than AI. So every academic journal entry

369
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,760
has been improved upon. We've been thinking and talking and writing about this for a long time

370
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:11,360
and researching it. And it continues to get better and better and better. In my view,

371
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:17,040
is in fact an enduring technology. Every year I'm a glass half empty kind of guy. I'm better

372
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,360
at predicting when technologies don't work. I have every year kind of the most ridiculous

373
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:27,280
technology award. Two years ago, it was the metaverse. Right. 40% of people who put on

374
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,840
that headset feel nauseous within 30 minutes. No one wants to go into a

375
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:38,480
in cell panic room. These things, I think big tech is a net positive for the world.

376
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:44,560
I do not believe that of meta. And I could not have invented a better strategy than to convince

377
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:52,480
a young man to spend $1.2 billion a month on his big go by Alaska dreams that people are going to

378
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,680
want to go into a legless universe and hang out with him and other people.

379
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:02,880
I think we all have an obligation. If you like me think the people who run meta are mendacious

380
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:10,960
fucks, I think that you have an obligation to talk up the metaverse because my fear is they wake up

381
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:16,400
from this consensual hallucination and start reducing the spend. So I think it has real

382
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:32,880
potential. Five days to 1 million users. Right. The curve on adoption and AI is blowing away

383
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:42,400
everything. We're in the fear mongering part of the cycle. I'm actually quite optimistic about AI,

384
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:49,280
which stands out, I think. And by the way, Tristan, who I adore and have a lot of respect for,

385
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,840
is worried about this and I purposely wanted to go to his talk yesterday to get insight into why

386
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:58,800
he's worried about it. But what I see is that every new technology, it's easier to understand

387
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:04,320
the downsides. Right. We knew that automation was going to fire a lot of people on the factory

388
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:09,280
floor and it did in the short term. But we didn't anticipate heated seats or car stereos and net

389
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,760
employment in the automobile industry actually went up. And so, yeah, I think there's going to

390
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,000
be some job destruction and I think there'll be some security risks. But the amount of new

391
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,120
businesses and opportunities by feeding your health records, your spending patterns into

392
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:27,360
these LLMs, you're going to come up with all sorts of new businesses and new ideas.

393
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:40,000
Okay. I'm going to skip this. Obviously, we hit kind of peak hype cycle. Everyone is talking

394
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:46,000
about AI, right? Kind of reminds me of 99 when you just said williamsonoma.com and your stock

395
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,640
price went up. And everyone's trying to figure out on the dark side here what industries it really

396
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:58,880
destroys. So the Czech CEO made the mistake of saying that he felt some pressure from chat GPT

397
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:05,440
and the stock lost 40% of its value in five minutes in the aftermarket. So investor relations

398
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,760
has really now become a story of spin. The number of journalists over the last 30 years has been cut

399
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:15,520
in half. The number of corporate PR executives, the number of comms people at companies has gone

400
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:21,600
up sixfold. So the ratio of bullshit to journalism has gone the wrong way 12x.

401
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,440
The reason why is that three out of four companies that went public 30 years ago were profitable and

402
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,800
we would assign a multiple within a fairly narrow range to get the valuation. Now three and four

403
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,840
companies that go public are not profitable or at least over the last 10 years, which means the

404
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:43,520
narrative is more important than the numbers. So the core competence of every CEO is to be a great

405
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:48,960
storyteller and capture people's imagination, pull cheap capital forward such that he or she

406
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:54,800
can over invest and run away from the competition. So as a result, the PR and comms people

407
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:00,240
manicuring Zuckerberg's image at Facebook now outnumber the number of journalists at the

408
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:07,760
Washington Post. Think about that. There's more people trying to kind of put wallpaper over these

409
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:13,040
lies that delay an obfuscation that is meta than there are journalists at the Washington Post.

410
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:18,960
Typically, technologies either create a bunch of new winners or they accrete to the existing players.

411
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:24,880
Search, social e-commerce went to new players, mobile went to existing players. You would argue

412
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:30,560
cloud kind of went to existing players. So far it looks like the big bursts of market capitalization

413
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:35,200
are going to existing players because it requires substantial infrastructure, specifically massive

414
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:42,160
processing power. Coming back to travel, I think there's a normal way to do that.

415
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:46,640
Coming back to travel, I think there's enormous opportunities in travel and AI. I'm going to the

416
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:52,000
Eurofinals with my 12 year old and we're playing with AI to try and create the ultimate weekend.

417
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:58,080
But you can see how this would be a tremendous time savings. Again, going back to time machines

418
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:06,160
to plan a great weekend. Give me a great weekend with six of my friends, all women in our 30s.

419
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,600
We want to go to Mexico. This is our economic weight class. These are our priorities and it

420
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:16,080
comes back with an itinerary and then a series of questions. What else can I answer for you?

421
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:20,800
Do you want me to make reservations? Confirm now. Do you want me to send emails out to the six

422
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:25,360
friends? I mean, you can just see this is going to get really exciting very fast in travel.

423
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:38,880
Okay, I had my first AI moment at LAX when I was coming in and I went to global entry and I started

424
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:44,000
putting my passport in and I heard Galloway and I'm a narcissist so I really thought, oh, it's a fan.

425
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:53,280
It was a woman from TSA saying, you're good. They're doing facial recognition and layering on AI

426
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,520
such that you can get right through the airport. I think that's fantastic. By the way, I'm all for

427
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:03,760
privacy violation as long as we have strong courts and people to oversee or punish companies when

428
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:08,480
they abuse that data. But the notion that if you give a flying fuck about privacy, it's hilarious.

429
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:15,120
As you'll tell everybody exactly what you're doing everywhere with a thin layer of AI. If

430
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:19,920
Uber gets hacked, we're going to know if you're having an affair, your HIV status, and if you

431
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:28,400
terminated a pregnancy. It is going to be, you have given up all privacy. This is the industry

432
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:35,360
that AI will disrupt and it's because it's the most disruptible industry. The way to describe

433
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:41,840
American healthcare is expensive but bad. It's outpaced inflation. It is now the largest industry

434
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:47,600
in our economy and only 20% of healthcare consumers are happy with their healthcare. Think about that.

435
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:53,280
It's raised prices faster than inflation for 30 or 40 years and only one in five consumers are

436
00:43:53,280 --> 00:44:01,680
happy with their healthcare. We spend $12,000 per person on healthcare. Think about Australia spends less than five.

437
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:10,880
And yet we die much earlier. Think about that. Mostly through deaths of despair, opioid addiction, suicide.

438
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:19,360
But think about just how ridiculous it is and also obesity. But that we have a nation that spends a lot

439
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:27,120
more than anyone else and yet we're dying earlier. And again, terrible satisfaction. So again, it's

440
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:32,320
more about how disruptible an industry is than the technology itself. And I think you're going to see

441
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:39,600
if I just was an economic animal, strong certification, some decent options professionally,

442
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:44,640
and I thought where is the most wind going to be in my sail, I would try and position myself somewhere

443
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:51,920
between AI and healthcare. Where you feed in your workouts, your nutrition. Here are just my grocery

444
00:44:51,920 --> 00:45:00,080
bills. Here's my fitness app. Here's my AMEX receipts and here's my blood work. And I want this AI model

445
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:05,280
to start managing my healthcare and making recommendations and take healthcare from a

446
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:11,760
defensive on your heels, disease driven application to an offensive health driven. And I think there's

447
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:17,760
going to be all sorts of costs. I don't have health insurance and people hear that and they go, Whoa,

448
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:24,240
no health insurance. Because health insurance for me and my family for the health insurance I want

449
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:31,840
is $50,000 a year. And because I have some economic security, I can absorb a big health scare. I could

450
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:38,240
absorb almost any health scare. And so I decided, all right, about 50% of our healthcare costs are

451
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:44,080
not being reimbursed. So I'm going to go without health insurance. I did that five years ago,

452
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:48,960
a quarter of a million dollars will buy a lot of healthcare. So what the healthcare industry has

453
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,480
done, especially the health insurance, the insurance part of the industry, which I think is the most

454
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:59,360
vulnerable 45% of all insurance costs in healthcare go to profits and administration. Meaning if you

455
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:04,800
spend $100 on health insurance, you're getting $55 back. If you're a younger person, you don't get

456
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,920
55 bucks, you get more like 25 or 35 because you're subsidizing people my age and older.

457
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,840
But we scare you. You're irresponsible. And what if you get really sick?

458
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:22,880
So again, it's another example of a very elegant transfer of wealth from young people to old people

459
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:30,240
under the same auspices of rejectionism or capital gains tax that rewards money more than sweat.

460
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:36,000
Who makes money off money? People my age. Who makes money off sweat? People your age. Second

461
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:42,560
biggest tax deduction in America, mortgage interest. Who owns homes? People my age. Who rents?

462
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:49,360
People your age. People over the age of 70 are 72% wealthier than they were 40 years ago. People

463
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:55,760
under the age of 40 in America are 24% less wealthy. Almost everything we do in America

464
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:01,440
is an elegant transfer of wealth from young people to old people. And we wonder why there's

465
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:06,720
a birth dearth. Birth rates are off 20% in the last five years. And everyone's staring

466
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:10,480
at their navel saying, why aren't young people having kids? It's because they can't afford them.

467
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,600
Want to see that again? All right.

468
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,400
We need a time machine in healthcare. Whoever builds it is going to make billions. Right now,

469
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:33,120
it takes two hours for an in-person visit. A telehealth visit takes 13 to 15 minutes. This

470
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:38,400
is enormous on-line. The mother of a child with diabetes, and let's be honest, it's always the mom,

471
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:43,600
spends five months of her year managing that child's healthcare. Think about that.

472
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:47,920
If a child with diabetes, between the referrals, the applications, the insurance,

473
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,640
you spend five months of your year managing that child's healthcare.

474
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:56,880
The pandemic did bring an acceleration in remote healthcare. Only about less than 3% of visits

475
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:02,480
were remote. It went almost to 40% during the pandemic. It's come down, but it's still an

476
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:10,880
enduring part of our healthcare system, remote visits. 38%. It's a huge unlock in mental health.

477
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:16,160
Right? This is especially dominant or is seen as a real innovation. And it's a huge

478
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:22,240
right? This is especially dominant or is seen as a real innovation in the mental health sector.

479
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,320
I think it's going to be big in fitness. I'm going to spend a lot of time there.

480
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,320
10 minutes. I'm going to cut to the end. I just thought it'd be fun to talk about

481
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:39,120
space tourism being on a Virgin boat. I think this is the most ridiculous business anywhere.

482
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Virgin Galactic was nothing but an elegant transfer of wealth from retail investors

483
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:49,280
who wanted to participate in the FOMO tech economy such that Richard Branson could keep

484
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:56,240
this ship operating during COVID. We spend more time. Just got very awkward in here.

485
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:04,320
We spend more time watching Jeff Bezos go up in a dildo than talking about climate change in 2022.

486
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:12,240
When Bob from accounting gets immolated on the launch pad, this entire industry goes away.

487
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,760
It is both supply constrained and demand constrained. There aren't that many people

488
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:21,920
want to spend $400,000 to go three times as high as you'll go on your way home. It's just,

489
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:28,240
it's, it's not only that, space is really, really difficult. There's a reason they call it space.

490
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:34,880
It doesn't want you there. It immediately begins destroying material and basically attacking any

491
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:40,400
organism. It's a terrible business. Space exploration, another ridiculous business,

492
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:46,080
ridiculous idea. And you got to hand it to them. The view will on Mars will take your breath away.

493
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:50,000
Literally, it'll take your breath away. You can't breathe there.

494
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,480
This is the weather here. This is the weather on Mars.

495
00:49:54,480 --> 00:50:00,160
Also, if you're a responsible person, you should absolutely take up base jumping before you go into

496
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:06,480
space. 550 people have gone into space. 11 have not come back. It has about 10 times the mortality

497
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:12,080
rate of base jumping. It's a very dangerous business. The part of space that does make sense

498
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:18,320
is space hauling. It's a very dangerous business. It's a very dangerous business.

499
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:23,760
It's a very dangerous business. The part of space that does make sense is space hauling,

500
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:30,320
specifically SpaceX. We need to get more defense and communication equipment. And it's essentially

501
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:36,080
who can get things up reliably and cheaply. I think SpaceX is going to be more valuable than

502
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:41,760
Tesla, mostly because Tesla's value will implode. It's a car company, not a software and energy

503
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:49,360
company. But SpaceX has figured out a way to get heavy materials into orbit much more cost-effectively.

504
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:56,640
Okay, I'm going to skip through this. Loneliness. My guess is you've heard a lot about this this

505
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:02,880
weekend. I'm working with Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, who's a very impressive and lovely man.

506
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:09,680
But any time you take one substance and transfer it or transition it to another,

507
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:14,480
there's externalities. Any time you take X and turn it into Y for economic gain, you're going to

508
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:19,200
have externalities. We turn plant-based calories into beef-based calories. We get methane and

509
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:25,600
deforestation. We take fossil fuels and we turn them into petroleum. And obviously, we get

510
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:31,200
externalities in the form of carbon. I do not believe that carbon emissions and climate change

511
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:36,960
are the most serious threat facing humanity. I think there's another externality that has arisen

512
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:42,400
because of the conversion of one substance to another that is a bigger threat. And that is the

513
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:49,360
conversion from advertising into dollars, or specifically from attention into advertising

514
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:55,920
into dollars. Because what we figured out in the 50s, 60s and 70s, we thought it was sex that would

515
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:01,600
keep you glued to your screen. But what we have found out is that the real sex that sells isn't

516
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:11,360
sex, it's rage. And as a result, the companies that are now building the most shareholder value

517
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:15,680
are the ones that basically are in the business of polarizing and dividing and depressing.

518
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:20,160
And why do I think it's the most dangerous emission? If we all hate each other, we're never

519
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:25,440
going to figure out a way to come to any sort of agreement or action plan around the other things

520
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:31,120
that ail us because we don't trust each other. The moment one group takes a position on something,

521
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:36,880
there's reason for the other group to suspect them and gaslight them, or basically not believe

522
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:43,280
it. It doesn't matter what it is. We used to be bipartisan around science. But I know the algorithms

523
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:49,200
like it when I say mRNA vaccines alter your DNA. Oh, we like that, elevate that content because it

524
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:55,040
pisses people off. And we'll get more comments, more engagement, more enragement, more engagement,

525
00:52:55,040 --> 00:53:05,840
more Nissan ads. The result is depression. One in three teenage girls have contemplated suicide.

526
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:13,440
One in five LGBTQ youth have attempted suicide. So I went back to my old high school, University

527
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:19,280
High School in West Los Angeles a few weeks ago, 2000 kids, assuming somewhere between five and

528
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:26,480
10% identify as LGBTQ, it's 200. That means 40 kids over the next three years are going to try

529
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:32,000
and kill themselves. When I was in high school, we had a memorial almost every weekend or every

530
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,760
week we come in, we'd say, Oh, no, we'd see a picture of somebody in a bunch of flowers.

531
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:42,000
And it was from almost always was from drunk driving. When I grew up, I lived in LA, there was

532
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:47,680
no public transportation, huge alcohol abuse, no airbags, mothers against drunk driving really hadn't

533
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:53,200
kicked in. And kids would take to Sunset Avenue totally fucked up and get in an accident with,

534
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:58,800
you know, no collapsible steering wheel shaft or airbags. And we had death all the time. Now

535
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:10,960
it's no longer drunkenness. It's the cars, it's depression. The fear I do have around AI is that

536
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:18,080
I worry that young people are entering into a series of low risk, low payoff relationships.

537
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:22,560
I'm going to convince myself I'm learning and then I'm investing and I'm going to go on Coinbase.

538
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,800
I'm going to convince myself I'm politically engaged by going on Twitter.

539
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:32,160
I'm going to convince myself I have friends, but I'm not really experiencing friendship.

540
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:38,320
And I think slowly but surely, especially young men who have very few mating opportunities because

541
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:44,640
online dating is kind of consolidated mating where the top 5% of males get 80% of the

542
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:52,400
opportunities. They're going to engage in a low risk, easy, low barrier relationships

543
00:54:53,120 --> 00:55:00,640
with sex bots and AI trained girlfriends. And I think this ultimately over time makes us depressed

544
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:05,280
that the reason we're happy, the reason we're joyous is we engage in victory.

545
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:12,160
We have obstacles that make the destination or the relationship more rewarding. There's a

546
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:19,280
reason the romantic comedies are two hours, not 10 minutes. Supposedly if you are, there's new

547
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:26,320
research showing if you smoked and had friends, right, or didn't smoke and had no friends,

548
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:32,720
you would live longer if you smoked a pack a day and had friends. And now one in seven males

549
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:39,520
don't have a single friend. Now, I mean, think about that. Think about the amount of joy. Think

550
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:45,840
about the prosperity, just a sense of self-worth, the laughter you've experienced with friends. And

551
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:52,080
one in seven males in America doesn't have a single friend. I'm not going to play the clip on her.

552
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:57,920
So I'm worried that slowly but surely we're going to start to replace human touch and what it means

553
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:05,200
to be a mammal and decide that, you know, trying to meet people is hard. Having the confidence to

554
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:10,640
approach someone and express romantic relationship while making them feel safe is a skill that young

555
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:17,600
men aren't establishing. And so they'll turn to AI and slowly but surely they'll sequester themselves

556
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:21,360
from the rest of the world, which I think leads to depression.

557
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:25,200
There's a woman who's now turned herself into a scalable girlfriend and she expects to make

558
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:33,680
$5 million this month, charging a buck a minute. I love this quote, right? It kind of summarizes it

559
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:39,280
all. What is love if it's not grief persevering? Most of my philosophy I get from Disney Plus.

560
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Okay, this is my last thing. I'm a bit of a downer, so I always try to

561
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:52,720
end with some up note. If you look at our catastrophizing and how down we become about the world and how bad things

562
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:58,720
become, a lot of it is the cadence of the news cycle. News used to be 22 minutes once a day,

563
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:04,720
then it turned into 20 hours. And now that it's every 20 seconds on your phone with notifications,

564
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:10,800
the only way to keep you on your screen is to catastrophize, right? Things marginally better

565
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:17,600
today is not a good headline. That doesn't work, right? So we have to create a situation for the

566
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:22,000
situation room. So we constantly catastrophize and make ourselves feel worse about the world

567
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,960
than each other. So if you looked and if you just took the perspective back and said, all right,

568
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:31,520
last year here's where the biggest headlines. Any headline you get every 20 seconds is usually

569
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:37,280
not a good headline. But what if you went back five years? Still kind of bad. And then you

570
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:46,960
know when hear that or am I having a stroke? So like a rumbling. Thanks for that.

571
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:56,400
If you went, if you went back 50 years, if you went one, five, 10, the news, if you had to pick

572
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,320
headlines, the news gets progressively better. The more perspective you have perspective is a

573
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:04,960
photographic term. And the more you create the angle wider, the better the news gets.

574
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,920
Because the reality is, if you're honest with yourself and you look at anything from a long

575
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:13,040
term perspective, the news just gets hard to hard to deny. It's pretty good. But would the news be

576
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:18,720
if you had one headline for the last 50 years? Probably be unprecedented prosperity led by China

577
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:24,480
in the US, or that abject poverty has been cut by 80%. If you could only pick one or two headlines,

578
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:28,400
you'd have no choice but probably to make them positive. And if you could only have one headline

579
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:36,000
for the last 100 years, what would it be? That's a very good one. Life expectancy in China,

580
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:42,080
since the year I was born has gone from 46 to now 76 and 500 million people have been bought out,

581
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:46,960
brought out of poverty in China over the last 30 years. But still, I think that probably the

582
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:51,040
headline for the last 100 years would be that the West turned back fascism, which is a great

583
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:56,880
headline. So as the cadence of news has increased, our sentiment has gone further and further down.

584
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,320
And we need some means of self correcting around all this negativity.

585
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,480
Okay, I'm not going to talk about how great it is to be an American.

586
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:14,240
I think a lot about regrets in time and how fast it's barreling. The majority of our existence

587
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:21,440
as a species, we didn't live past 34. For about 99.9% of our time as homo sapiens, we lived to be

588
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:27,200
about 30 or 34. We died in childbirth, died in war, conflict, a broken bone or a bad cut,

589
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:34,080
and then death. So our brains literally can't process us past the age of 35 or 40. By the way,

590
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:39,920
by the time you hit 38, you have trouble adapting to the way you look after that.

591
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:44,560
Every day you look in the mirror, you're like, shit, because you can't process it,

592
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:53,680
because you're not supposed to be here. In addition, you can't get your mind around time.

593
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:58,560
And ask anyone in this audience over the age of 40, time literally begins to fall off a cliff.

594
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:04,640
Years become seasons. And I'm fascinated with what are the biggest regrets at the end of your life.

595
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:08,560
My colleague Adam Alter has done great work on this. And I only got another minute or so here.

596
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:13,280
And he does, he spends a lot of time with people at the end and palliative care.

597
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:18,480
And their regrets basically boil down to three things. I wish I'd lived the life I wanted to live,

598
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:23,040
not the life that others wanted me to live. I wish I'd stayed in touch with friends. And most

599
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:29,120
importantly, I wish I'd been less hard on myself. I wish I'd forgiven myself. I think about this a

600
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:33,360
lot as I'm barreling towards the end. I'm an atheist. I think at some point I'll look into

601
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:37,360
my kid's eyes and know that our relationship is coming to an end. And I find it a source of power.

602
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:42,720
But if you're successful, you live a lot in the past. You call on your credentials and your

603
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:47,040
experience to try and inform your current actions. And if you're like me and you suffer

604
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:51,520
from depression and anger, you spend the majority of your waking hours in the past.

605
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:56,080
God, I can't believe what a fucking idiot I am. I can't believe I did that. I can't believe I said

606
01:00:56,080 --> 01:01:03,840
that. You're constantly beating yourself up, right? Can't get past this immutable thing called the

607
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:10,160
past. You just can't get past it. And if you're successful, also, I'll say like me, you're a lot

608
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:14,880
in the future. You're constantly trading off the short term. You're constantly planning. I got on

609
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:20,320
this boat yesterday because I was supposed to speak at 3.30. I don't like boats. I've never been

610
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:26,160
on one before. I'm agoraphobic. I don't like people much. And so when I saw the boat was still docked,

611
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:31,920
I thought I'm going to do this talk and bomb to Miami airport, get home. And I was already planning

612
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:36,480
the Tottenham Spurs-Brentford game with my sons and what I was going to do with my free time.

613
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:41,760
I was already in the future planning how to be more productive. And chances are, if I'd made that

614
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:46,960
football game, I would have been on my phone, virtue signaling that I was with my son, checking

615
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:53,040
the amount of likes I got, thinking about what I was going to do the next day. Never really there,

616
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:58,240
right? Never, you know, always in the future, always in the past, never really there. And I

617
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:04,000
like what Sam Harris says. The past is the most immutable thing in the world. The future is the

618
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:09,120
most mutable thing. Unfortunately, we don't have a lot of control over it. But this is

619
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:15,120
it. This is what we, this is it. It's the only really, the only thing we have is the here and

620
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:22,560
the now. And my biggest fear, and I think about this a lot, is that I'll be at the end and I'll

621
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:29,440
look back and I'll go, oh my God, unbelievable blessings, staggering prosperity that I didn't

622
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:38,640
expect. People I love and that love me immensely, right? But I was never really there for it.

623
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:51,840
Did my life happen? So I leave this with a question. And it's something I ask myself all the time now.

624
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,160
Are you here?

625
01:02:54,160 --> 01:03:04,160
Are you there? That's all I got.
