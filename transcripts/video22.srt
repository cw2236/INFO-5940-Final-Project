00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
Apple's headset is going to be one of the biggest tech failures.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:08,200
I think it's going to rival the Oculus, and it will officially be the most elegant final

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:14,600
nail in the coffin of this sort of headset-driven VR consensual hallucination.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:20,000
I think that Apple likely greenlit this project a couple years ago when it looked like VR

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,240
offered more potential.

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,680
Everybody thinks that Mark Zuckerberg and Evan Spiegel are smarter than them, and everyone

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,400
wants to look and feel younger and wants to know what the youngins are thinking.

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,640
And I bet that Tim Cook said, we hate Mark Zuckerberg.

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,640
VR offers a lot of potential to go to Greece without going to Greece and perform heart

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:43,760
surgery from the Cleveland Clinic on a little girl in a developing country, whatever it

11
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,760
might be.

12
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,040
And I just don't think it's panning out.

13
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,440
And I think if they had it to do over, they would take that billion dollars back they've

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,520
spent on this thing and not release it.
