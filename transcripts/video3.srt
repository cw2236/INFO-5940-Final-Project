1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
My name is Scott Galloway, I teach at NYU, and I appreciate your time.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,540
I have 44 slides in 720 seconds.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,000
Let's light this candle.

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,340
Okay, so for those of you who don't know me,

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,460
I'm actually a global television story.

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,540
True story, I've had four TV series in the last three years,

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,060
two of them being canceled before they were launched,

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,880
and two were canceled within six weeks.

9
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,140
Let's recap.

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,580
If we want to juice this thing, if we want to put a cattle prod,

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,340
how about we put a pig in it?

12
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,620
Bloomberg, the most trusted name in financial news.

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,440
Not for long.

14
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,240
I'm going to do whatever I can for this country of ours, Scott.

15
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,460
Jesus Christ.

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,680
Jesus, come on, dude.

17
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,960
You're 0 for 2.

18
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,280
Are you used to it?

19
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,160
Face for podcasting.

20
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,560
So first inside of the day,

21
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,220
I'd like to be the first person to welcome you to the last test.

22
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,240
Okay.

23
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,320
By the way, it's clear that the first person to welcome you

24
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,920
to the last test is Scott Galloway.

25
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,880
Okay.

26
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,200
By the way, it's clear that what's it called?

27
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,420
What are we here for?

28
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,860
The brave and the brilliant.

29
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,640
It's clear that Chris is a frustrated soap opera producer.

30
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,160
Essentially, what we have here is a telenovela

31
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,380
where after a night of unbridled passion

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,380
between Bill Gates and Malcolm Gladwell,

33
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,080
they give birth to their bastard love child,

34
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,300
Simon Sinek.

35
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,360
(*Laughter*)

36
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,800
Okay.

37
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,100
I start us with a question.

38
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,320
Do we love our children?

39
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,560
Sounds like an illegitimate question, right?

40
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,960
Well, I'm going to try and convince you otherwise.

41
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,460
Essentially, as we go down generations,

42
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,700
we're seeing that for the last two generations,

43
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,160
people are making less money on an inflation-adjusted basis.

44
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,380
In addition, the cost of buying a home,

45
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,320
the cost of pursuing education,

46
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,680
continues to skyrocket.

47
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,200
So the purchasing power, the prosperity,

48
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,700
is inversely correlated to age.

49
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,200
Simply put, as we get younger,

50
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,360
we're taking away opportunity and prosperity from our youngest.

51
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,080
The social contract that is now no longer in place,

52
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,120
and for the first time in the US's history,

53
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,100
a 30-year-old is no longer doing as well

54
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,840
as his or her parents were at 30.

55
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:06,700
This is a breakdown in the fundamental agreement we have with any society,

56
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,360
and it creates rage and shame.

57
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,820
(*Applause*)

58
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,220
As a result, people over the age of 55 feel pretty good about America,

59
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,940
but less than one in five people under the age of 34

60
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,980
feel very good about America.

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,980
This creates an incendiary.

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,100
Righteous movements, cuts to our society,

63
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,020
end up becoming opportunistic infections,

64
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,120
because generally speaking, young people have a warranted envy,

65
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,960
they're pissed off, and they're angry

66
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,800
that they don't enjoy the same spoils and prosperity

67
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,820
that were provided to our generation.

68
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,500
A decent proxy for how much we value youth labor is minimum wage,

69
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,420
and we've kept it purposely pretty low.

70
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,440
If it had just kept pace with productivity,

71
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,960
it'd be about 23 bucks a share,

72
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,080
but we've decided to purposely keep it low.

73
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,280
Out of reach, median home price has skyrocketed

74
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,640
relative to median household income.

75
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:56,540
As a result, pre-pandemic, the average mortgage payment was $1,100.

76
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,060
It's now $2,300 because of acceleration in interest rates

77
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,140
and the fact that the average home has gone from 290,000 to 420.

78
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,240
By the way, the most expensive homes in the world,

79
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,860
based on this metric, are number three, Vancouver.

80
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,420
Why? Because 60 percent of the cost of building a home goes to permits,

81
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,600
because guess what?

82
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,400
The incumbents that own assets have weaponized government

83
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,360
to make it very difficult for new entrants to ever get their own assets,

84
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,760
thereby elevating their own net worth.

85
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,400
This is the transfer I'm going to be speaking about.

86
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,040
(*Applause*)

87
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,400
This has resulted in an enormous transfer of wealth,

88
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:38,080
where people over the age of 70 used to control 19 percent of household income

89
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,440
versus people under the age of 40 used to control 12.

90
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,520
Their wealth has been cut in half.

91
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,060
This isn't by accident, it's purposeful.

92
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,100
This is me at UCLA in 1987.

93
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,900
I know your first thought is, I haven't changed a bit.

94
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,100
(*Laughter*)

95
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,620
This is also Mia Severio,

96
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,100
who is the analyst who put together these slides.

97
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,300
By the way, Mia is 26.

98
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,500
I did the math.

99
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,660
Just by virtue of her being in this audience,

100
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,860
it brings the average age of the entire conference down 11 days.

101
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,140
(*Laughter*)

102
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,640
When I applied to UCLA, the admissions rate was 76 percent.

103
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,340
Today, it's nine percent.

104
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,760
I received a 2.23 GPA from UCLA.

105
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,560
I learned nothing but how to make bonds out of household items

106
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,400
and every line from planet to the apes.

107
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,920
And the greatest public school in the world, Berkeley,

108
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,960
decided to let me in with a 2.27 GPA.

109
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,040
And that's what higher ed is about.

110
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,160
Higher ed is about taking unremarkable kids

111
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,440
and giving them a shot at being remarkable.

112
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,700
(*Applause*)

113
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,140
And every year, it's gotten more expensive.

114
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,280
Higher ed and homes and the ability,

115
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,920
not only is higher ed incredibly expensive,

116
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,520
it's not accessible,

117
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,720
because me and my colleagues are drunk on luxury,

118
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,120
and I'll come back to that.

119
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,200
We've embraced the ultimate strategy.

120
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,760
Me and my colleagues in higher ed wake up every morning

121
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,000
and ask ourselves the same question when we look in the mirror.

122
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,800
How can I increase my compensation while reducing my accountability?

123
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,280
(*Laughter*)

124
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,280
And we have found the ultimate strategy.

125
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,120
It's called an LVMH strategy,

126
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,660
where we artificially constrain supply to create aspiration and scarcity,

127
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,320
such that we can raise tuition faster than inflation.

128
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,020
And old people and wealthy people have done the same thing with housing.

129
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,900
All of a sudden, once you own a home, you become very concerned with traffic,

130
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,660
and you make sure that there's no new housing permits.

131
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,300
And here is a memo to my colleagues in higher ed.

132
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,340
We're public servants, not fucking Chanel bags.

133
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:37,900
(*Applause*)

134
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,640
Harvard is the best example of this.

135
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,320
They've increased their endowment in the last 40 years

136
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,880
and have decided to expand their enrollment, their freshman class, by 4 percent.

137
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,680
Any university that doesn't grow their freshman class

138
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,680
faster than population that has over a billion dollars in endowment

139
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,320
should lose their tax-free status,

140
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,520
because they're no longer in higher education,

141
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,480
they're a hedge fund offering classes.

142
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:05,000
(*Applause*)

143
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,740
My first recommendation,

144
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,460
Biden should take some of that 750 billion earmarked

145
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,260
to bail out the one-third of people that got to go to college

146
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,900
on the backs of the two-thirds that didn't,

147
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,100
and give a billion dollars to our 500 greatest public institutions,

148
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,140
size-adjusted, in exchange for three things.

149
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,100
One, they use technology and scale to reduce tuition by 2 percent a year,

150
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,140
expand enrollments by 6 percent a year,

151
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,720
and increase the number of vocational certifications

152
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,160
and non-traditional four-year degrees by 20 percent.

153
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,800
Where does that get us?

154
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,680
In just 10 years,

155
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,160
that doubles the freshman seats and cuts the cost in half.

156
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:44,400
This isn't radical, this is called college in the 80s and 90s.

157
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,080
Another transfer of wealth.

158
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,880
Look at what's happened to wages.

159
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,360
Oh, they've gone up, not as much as corporate profits.

160
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,920
There's a healthy tension between capital and labor.

161
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,720
For the last 40 years, capital has been kicking the shit out of labor.

162
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,020
Well, you think, whoa, what about wages, right?

163
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,140
They've gone up.

164
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,300
Well, if you compare them to the S&P, they barely register.

165
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,260
It's been an amazing time to own assets,

166
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,260
but your attempt to get the certification

167
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,460
or the income such that you can acquire assets

168
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,940
has gotten harder and harder.

169
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,100
In my class of 300 kids, it's never been easier to be a billionaire,

170
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,260
it's never been harder to be a millionaire.

171
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,580
By the way, our job in higher ed

172
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,020
isn't to identify a top one percent of people who are freakishly remarkable

173
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,320
or have rich parents and turn them into a superclass of billionaires,

174
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:30,760
it's to give the bottom 90 a chance to be in the top 10.

175
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:36,960
You know who doesn't need me or higher education?

176
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,680
The top 10 percent.

177
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,920
The whole point of higher ed is to give the unremarkables,

178
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,280
I, yours truly, who was raised by a single immigrant mother,

179
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,980
a shot of being remarkable.

180
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,400
The transfer has been purposeful,

181
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,560
while the cohorts, corporations and the ultra-wealthy

182
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,620
continue to garner more and more of our wealth,

183
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,780
we have decided, I know, if they win the gold,

184
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,140
let's give them the silver and the bronze and let's lower their taxes.

185
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,040
This transfer is purposeful, it's not by accident.

186
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,140
And it works.

187
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,820
Senior poverty is way down, and we should celebrate that.

188
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,320
Meanwhile, child poverty is flat to up.

189
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,420
The third rail, I'm going to talk about social security.

190
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,500
It would cost 11 billion dollars to expand the child tax credit,

191
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,940
but that gets stripped out of the infrastructure bill.

192
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:25,080
But the additional 135 billion dollars a year to social security,

193
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,840
that flies right through Congress.

194
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:31,480
And every year, we transfer 1.4 trillion dollars

195
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,080
from a cohort that is increasingly doing less well

196
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:40,380
to the cohort that is the wealthiest cohort in the history of this planet.

197
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,920
I'm not against social security,

198
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,040
but the criteria should be if you need it,

199
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,780
not whether you have a catheter.

200
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,520
Eighty percent of you,

201
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:54,440
80 percent of you have absolutely no reason to ever take social security.

202
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,120
It is bankrupting our nation,

203
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,920
and we have fallen under this mythology

204
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,280
that somehow it's this great social program.

205
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,620
No, it's not, it's the great transfer of wealth from young to old.

206
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,480
(*Applause*)

207
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,480
How is this happening?

208
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,680
Because our representatives are in fact representative.

209
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,880
Old people vote.

210
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,920
(*Laughter*)

211
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,780
Washington has become a cross between the land of the dead

212
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,180
and the golden girls.

213
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,960
(*Laughter*)

214
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,140
Quite frankly, this is fucking ridiculous.

215
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,360
And if I sound ageist,

216
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,300
if I sound ageist, I am.

217
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,940
And you know who else is ageist?

218
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,260
Biology.

219
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,620
(*Laughter*)

220
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,980
When Speaker Pelosi had her first child,

221
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,260
get this, two-thirds of households didn't have color televisions,

222
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,660
and Castro had just declared martial law.

223
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,360
But she's supposed to understand the challenges

224
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,680
of a 17-year-old girl who's 5'9", 95 pounds,

225
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,640
getting tips on dieting and extreme dieting from Facebook.

226
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,040
She's supposed to understand the challenges

227
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,940
that a 27-year-old single mother face.

228
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,520
By the way, young and dreamy.

229
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,800
(*Laughter*)

230
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,080
Young and dreamy.

231
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:10,260
(*Applause*)

232
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:14,480
The great intergenerational theft took place under the auspices of a virus.

233
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,500
I know.

234
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,020
Let's use the greatest health crisis in the century

235
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,740
to really speedball the transfer.

236
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,940
This is the NASDAQ from 2008 to 2012.

237
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,980
We let the markets crash.

238
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,540
And by the way, you need churn, you need disruption,

239
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,220
because it seeds and recalibrates advantage and wealth

240
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,140
from the incumbents to the entrants.

241
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,260
It's a natural part of the cycle.

242
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:40,100
But wait, lately, no, a million people dying would be bad,

243
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,740
but what would be tragic is if we let the NASDAQ go down

244
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,680
and guys like me lost wealth.

245
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,200
So we pumped the economy,

246
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,560
which again, increased the massive transfer of wealth.

247
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,960
The best two years of my life, COVID.

248
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,360
More time with my kids, more time with Netflix,

249
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:58,800
and the value of my stocks absolutely exploded.

250
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,240
And who has to pay for my prosperity?

251
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,560
Not me.

252
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:07,700
Future generations who will have to deal with an unprecedented level of debt.

253
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,760
Why am I here and why do I get the prosperity I enjoy?

254
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,980
Because in 2008, we bailed out the banks,

255
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,740
but we didn't bail out the economy.

256
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,380
We let the markets fall.

257
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,500
So as I was coming into my prime income earning years,

258
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:23,140
I got to buy, no joke, these stocks at these prices.

259
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,700
This is where those stocks are now.

260
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,460
Where does a young person find disruption?

261
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,020
When you bail out the baby boomer owner of a restaurant,

262
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,980
all you're doing is robbing opportunity

263
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,020
from the 26-year-old graduate of a culinary academy

264
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,220
that wants her shot.

265
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,560
We need disruption.

266
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:55,660
I just like this slide.

267
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,220
It has no context or relevance.

268
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,280
We're economically attacking the young, but I know.

269
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,800
Let's attack their emotional and mental well-being.

270
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,760
Let's take advantage of the fact of the flaws in our species

271
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,720
with medieval institutions,

272
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,840
paleolithic instincts and godlike technology.

273
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,760
I'm just going to say, I think Mark Zuckerberg has done more damage

274
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,960
to young people in our nation while making movies.

275
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:19,200
I think that's a good example of how we can take advantage of the fact

276
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:22,000
that we have a lot of people who are not as good as we are.

277
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,960
And I think that's a good example of how we can take advantage

278
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,220
of the fact that Mark Zuckerberg has done more damage to young people

279
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,780
while making more money than any person in history.

280
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,700
Oh, but wait, what would get you worse?

281
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,060
It's as if we let an adversary implant a neural jack into our youth

282
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,220
to raise a generation of civic, military and business leaders

283
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,400
that hate America.

284
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,120
How can we be this stupid?

285
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,620
All right, this all adds up to a bunch of graphs,

286
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,420
all headed up and to the right.

287
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,660
And what are they?

288
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,820
What's the first one?

289
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,140
Oh, that's self-harm rates, which have exploded,

290
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,880
and it's been a month, girls, since my colleague Jonathan Haidt pointed out,

291
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,520
it's really gone crazy since social went on mobile.

292
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,680
What's the next one?

293
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,400
Teens with depression.

294
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,740
The next one, men and women not having sex.

295
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,360
Biggest fear of my parents was that I was going to get into too much trouble.

296
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:14,320
My biggest fear, honestly, is that my kids aren't going to get into enough trouble.

297
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:17,400
By the way, my advice to every young person watching this program

298
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:21,000
is go out, drink more and make a series of bad decisions that might pay off.

299
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,260
Next graph, human or gun deaths.

300
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,540
You're more likely to be shot in the United States

301
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,660
if you're a toddler or an infant than a cop.

302
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,420
Next graph, obesity.

303
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,580
Way up.

304
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,020
By the way, the industrial food complex wants to addict you to shitty fatty food

305
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,260
so they can hand you over to the industrial diabetes complex.

306
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,980
We should not romanticize obesity.

307
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,980
You're not finding your fucking truth, you're finding diabetes.

308
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,020
Overdose deaths.

309
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,020
Way up.

310
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,220
Deaths of despair.

311
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,980
When I was in high school, it was true.

312
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,980
I was a kid, I was a kid, I was a kid.

313
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,080
Deaths of despair.

314
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,240
When I was in high school, it was drunk driving,

315
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,960
now it's kids killing themselves.

316
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,240
Young people don't want to have kids anymore.

317
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,560
Two-thirds of people aged 30 to 34, able-bodied,

318
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,520
used to decide to have at least one child.

319
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,720
It's been cut in half.

320
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,760
It's now less than a third, 27 percent.

321
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:08,040
As a result, people over the age of 60 in the US, pretty happy.

322
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,200
People under the age of 30, not so much.

323
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,440
Some of the lowest in the free world.

324
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,640
What can we do?

325
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,960
Nothing wrong with America that can't be fixed with what's right with it.

326
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,640
We got the hard stuff figured out.

327
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,100
We got the problems to address all of these issues,

328
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,420
they cost a lot of money, that's the hard part.

329
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,980
And we have figured this out.

330
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,060
In just five minutes, post an earnings call,

331
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,900
we can add a quarter of a trillion dollars to the economy.

332
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,600
We've got the hard part figured out, the resources.

333
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,580
We have the money, but we decide not to do it.

334
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,620
This is per capita spending on childcare in the United States

335
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,060
relative to other nations.

336
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,140
This is housing permanence.

337
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,380
Things are doable.

338
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,940
We increased minimum wage to 25 bucks an hour.

339
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,620
It goes into the economy.

340
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,600
The wonderful things about low- and middle-income households

341
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,080
is they spend all their money.

342
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,440
We have to have a restore or a progressive tax structure

343
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,760
with alternative minimum tax on corporations and wealthy individuals.

344
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,080
We need to refund the IRS.

345
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,880
We need to reform Social Security.

346
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:05,360
It should be based on whether you need the money, not on how old you are.

347
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,880
We need a negative income tax.

348
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,120
My friend Andrew Yang screwed up a great idea,

349
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,680
but he branded it incorrectly.

350
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,760
Instead of calling it UBI, he should have got Republicans on board

351
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,600
by calling it a negative income tax.

352
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,180
We need to eliminate the capital gains tax deduction.

353
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,940
When did we decide that the money the capital earns

354
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,420
is more noble than the money that sweat earns?

355
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,660
Shouldn't it be flipped?

356
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,740
(*Applause*)

357
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:31,140
We need to remove 230 protection for algorithmically elevated content.

358
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,940
We need identity verification.

359
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:37,840
The reason we can have identity verification is because we have a First Amendment.

360
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,820
Break up big tech.

361
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,620
We have monopolies that are incurring greater and greater costs

362
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,860
on every small business,

363
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,680
because again, see above, our representatives don't understand these technologies.

364
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,280
We need to age-gate social media.

365
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,920
There's absolutely no reason anyone under the age of 16

366
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,680
should ever be on social media.

367
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,240
(*Applause*)

368
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,920
We need universal pre-K.

369
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,920
We need to reinstate the expanded child tax credit.

370
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,400
We need term limits, see above, Andrew Yang.

371
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,280
We need income-based affirmative action.

372
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,840
Any visible signs of affirmative action make no sense at all.

373
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,200
You would rather be born gay or non-white,

374
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,460
and that's a sign of our progress and our need to recalibrate

375
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,980
who we give advantage to.

376
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,580
Affirmative action, of which I'm a beneficiary,

377
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,700
I got Pell grants, I got unfair advantage,

378
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,100
affirmative action is a wonderful thing, and it should be based on color.

379
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,940
It should be based on green, how much money you have or don't have.

380
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,980
Expand college enrollment and vocational programs,

381
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,260
mental health, band phones in schools,

382
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,180
invest in third places, big brothers and sisters programs,

383
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,300
and more.

384
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,960
We need to tell people in the United States and Canada

385
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,360
that they live in the greatest countries in the world,

386
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,680
and we need to remind them of that every day

387
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:49,520
by exposing them to other great Americans where they feel connected to you.

388
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,560
We can do all of this.

389
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,800
We can do all of it.

390
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,560
We have the resources, the question is, do we have the will?

391
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,960
This is my last slide.

392
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,280
It is an emotionally manipulative slide to try and get you to like me more.

393
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,300
(*Laughter*)

394
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,640
And I'm going to try to get you to like me more.

395
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,620
But it does have a message.

396
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,820
This is the whole shooting match.

397
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,020
Anybody here without kids, ask someone with kids.

398
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,700
You have your will to work, you have your will to friends,

399
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,060
you have your will to kids.

400
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:20,080
Something happens here, your whole world shrinks to this.

401
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:28,320
(*Applause*)

402
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,880
(*Applause*)

403
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,900
So I present as I wrap here, which is a few questions.

404
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:43,180
One, if you acknowledge that our kids are the most important thing in our lives,

405
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,380
that everything else we do here is meaningful,

406
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,180
but our kids' well-being and prosperity is profound.

407
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:53,620
If you acknowledge that they're doing more poorly than previous generations,

408
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,980
if you believe there's a chance that the illusion of complexity

409
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,000
has done nothing but provide cloud cover

410
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,720
for the unbelievable transfer of goodwill,

411
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,280
of well-being and of prosperity from young to old,

412
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,960
and if you believe we can actually fix these problems

413
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,640
and we have the resources,

414
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,320
then I present to you,

415
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:16,320
I posit, I augur the question that I hope has more veracity than it did

416
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:19,320
17 minutes and 24 seconds ago.

417
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,180
And that's the following question.

418
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,500
Do we love our children?

419
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:30,600
My name is Scott Gallo, I teach at NYU, and I appreciate your time.

420
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,620
(*Applause*)

421
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,880
Thank you.

422
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,100
Thank you.
