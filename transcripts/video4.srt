1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,220
We worship at the altar of innovators and billionaires. I think this perversion is best typified by the shit show

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:12,500
I refer to as HQ 2 where Amazon is gamified the HQ 2 process and basically

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:21,900
Created a game which will result in a transfer of wealth from municipalities fire districts school districts and police forces to Amazon shareholders

4
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,320
I believe it is a ruse. I believe they have absolutely no intention of being in any of these 18 cities

5
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:33,360
I believe this game was over before it started where will their headquarters be it's very simple

6
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:40,080
If you are the wealthiest man in the world and you're 54 and as someone who's in his 50s and is fairly economically secure

7
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,080
Obviously not on the same magnitude. I can tell you start measuring your life in days and weeks

8
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,680
I have ten more

9
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,140
Christmases with my youngest son. I have 35 more on this planet. I don't do pretty much anything

10
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,320
I don't want to do anymore

11
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,200
So query me this if you're the wealthiest man in the world at a hundred and sixty five billion dollars

12
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,240
Which means you have more options than anyone else in the world

13
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:04,900
Are you going to despite decide to spend three months a year much less three minutes in Indianapolis?

14
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,120
Let's again talk about human behavior

15
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,580
The way it usually go downs in households in terms of what's best for the welfare of the children is

16
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:22,120
Dad's an influencer and mom is the decider if you're miss Bezos again tied for number one is the wealthiest person in the world

17
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,280
And you endure rainy Seattle ten months a year. Are you gonna decide that you and your kids should spend more time in Toronto?

18
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,560
This was over before it started the Bezos have two houses one in New York one in DC

19
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,560
The next headquarters will be DC because the only thing in between

20
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,640
Amazon and one trillion and two trillion in market cap is regulation

21
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:48,840
No one is going to regulate the gentleman showing throwing out the first pitch of the 2019 Washington National Seasons

22
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,840
Which will be Jeffrey Bezos

23
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,320
You
