 Thanks for having me. My name is Scott Galloway. I teach at NYU and I appreciate your time today. I'm coming to you live from a small a small sandbar in the Atlantic called Nantucket. Over the course of the next 35 minutes I'll be taking you through approximately 130 slides and then hopefully we'll leave time for 10 minutes of Q&A. So with that let's bust right into it. So we're going to talk about COVID's enduring feature as more of an accelerant than a change agent. We'll also look at some of these changes through the lens of the companies I spend the most time thinking about Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google. We'll talk about an emerging crisis among young men and some predictions for 2021 and then what we believe is the profound opportunity. Some disclosures, I have investment stakes or ownerships in the following private and public companies. So just in terms of if I sound as if I am promoting a company I probably am but these are the firms that I have economic stakes in. Okay decades and days. There's a great quote attributed to Lenin that says there are decades where nothing happens and there are weeks where decades happen. I think we're in the former and that is we tend to think of time as a function of these astrophysical objects circling a hot plasma called the sun but as humans we register time as a function of change and it seems as if time is accelerating if you will. In the U.S. to give you a scale of the crisis here just in one month last April we lost more Americans than we lost in the entire Vietnam conflict and the numbers get even more staggering. At one point we were losing the same number of American souls we lost in the attacks of 9-11 every 17 hours in the U.S. Obviously in Brazil and in India we have seen the same type of mortality rates and is arguably the greatest public health crisis in the last century. There's no easy way to segue to business. I'll just segue to business. There have been three big shifts in our economy our modern economy. The first is globalization comparative advantage. The second digitization simply put the internet and then I think we're on the precipice of a third big shift in our modern economy and that is dispersion. What do we mean by dispersion? So the ability to distribute products or services from the source creator to the end user the end stakeholder reshaping the supply chain such that the source creator gets greater margins and the end user gets to access the product with less friction or lower cost. I think of it almost as leapfrogging right whether it's Peloton leapfrogging the gym whether it's Wonder Woman 1984 coming directly to your TV in your home as opposed to having to go to a theater whether it's Zoom bringing us to bringing work letting you rent your human capital to an organization leapfrogging an office building or whether it's what we're doing now where we can leapfrog the physical infrastructure of a conference and go directly to the end consumer. We're seeing this dispersion of value if you will in a reshaping of the supply chain across almost every industry and I think that presents tremendous opportunities and tremendous challenges and what will probably be the greatest reshuffling of stakeholder value since the introduction of the internet. The biggest industry that will be most impacted by this is healthcare and that is the healthcare industrial complex is being dispersed. What do I mean by that? Probably 99 plus of the people who have contracted endured and developed antibodies for the novel coronavirus will have never entered a hospital much less a doctor's office. The number of people who were seeing doctors virtually has absolutely exploded. It was less than one percent pre-pandemic it's almost a third now of visits are done virtually. That will go down once the pandemic has subsided but it's not going back to one percent. We've seen a similar phenomenon in Brazil where we've seen an explosion in telehealth. We're also going to see a dispersion in education and that is in my industry we've used admissions departments and the physical limits of a campus to gate or constrain artificially in my view the supply of seats at great universities. I think a lot of the intellectual property and certification is being dispersed to remote appliances such that we can expand hopefully expand the offering and education can be dispersed. In the U.S. it's a 750 billion dollar business globally it's a two trillion dollar business. Why is there such a rush to disperse education? Because my industry has raised prices faster than almost any other industry maybe with the exception of healthcare. Tuition in the U.S. is up 1400 percent in the last 30 years. To give you a sense of just how outrageous the pricing has become I teach a course called brand strategy at the NYU Stern School of Business. Every student has to spend seven thousand dollars U.S. to take my course not for the year that's just to take my one course. I have 280 students in my class in the fall or put another way my course generates approximately 1.96 million dollars just that one course. Now think about this I have returned my compensation to the school for the last 10 years so I can continue to bite the hand that doesn't feed me but try and imagine another product that gets a two million dollar price tag with 98 points maybe 99 points of gross margin. The only other product I could find is a product called Zolgensma which is a life-saving gene therapy that is literally a knockout drug. Two doses of this cures a rare genetic disease so either cure save your life or brand strategy with Professor Scott Galloway. I don't think either of those is sustainable. We're going to see incredible dispersion of media. We use the example of media going straight to our smartphones or our speakers and skipping not only the supply chain of movie theaters but skipping the traditional arbiters of what gets greenlit. You can go on YouTube now you can go on TikTok and you can garner a huge following without the permission or the green light from a studio executive or an agent. Theaters are obviously being massively disrupted here in the U.S. When we think about media there's really only two media formats that are growing over the top streaming and video games. Every other media is suffering and losing oxygen if you will. We're also seeing an incredible dispersion in finance and that is where disruption is typically a disruptor if you will or a new player comes in and starts focusing on a market that's been overlooked because the incumbents see them as unprofitable. An example of this in Argentina would be Walla that is going after the 50 percent of Argentinians that don't have a bank account. Neobank in Brazil we are seeing incredible disruption where people are going after these companies have access to cheap capital, leveraging smartphones, leveraging technology and building from the ground up a cohort that had previously been ignored. The result is the marketplace loves these disruptors and provides them with valuations greater than the incumbents. So look at this PayPal is worth dramatically more than Goldman Sachs and Square will soon be worth more than Morgan Stanley. These are financial institutions that took generations some even centuries to build and these disruptors are already have already garnered more stakeholder value. Crypto is a dispersion of trust from central banks to new assets and also a younger generation that doesn't believe the current asset classes are serving them well. When we have bailouts that prop up the markets there's a general feeling among people under the age of 30 that they have to create their own asset classes to have the same opportunities that their parents had and you're seeing tremendous traction of these asset classes and adoption across institutions and retail. In the U.S. there are now just as many people of color in the investment markets as whites mostly because they have engaged with new trading apps and also they're interested in cryptocurrencies. So we talk about this in the context of opportunity but there's also some very serious societal concerns specifically dispersion if you will is kind of the evil cousin of segregation and that is when we no longer go to the mall the movie theater or even to work we interact less often with people from different races and different income classes and we lose empathy when we no longer see the homeless veteran the homeless person the single mother at the mall the grocery store the movie theater we have less empathy for them. There's been studies showing that when a minority group grows in population if you live near them you have empathy for them if you do not live near them and they are segregated you begin to resent them. Let's talk a little bit about the four. We are seeing these companies now have the power and I believe the influence of nation states. I believe Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google are singularly more powerful and influential than almost any entities in the world maybe the exception of China in the U.S. and if you look at their market capitalizations and I realize it's apples to oranges they have a greater economic value or market capitalization than the GDP of several large nations. They are also becoming so dominant that they are beginning to soak up all the oxygen in the markets. Just five companies now represent a quarter of all the value of the S&P 500 and we're seeing tremendous increase in market capitalization. They have absolutely accelerated the pandemic they have gained power they have increased their market capitalization. Think about this one company Apple is worth more than the hundred biggest companies in the United Kingdom combined so essentially we have one firm that is bigger than the biggest companies in a large economy. Now why is this bad? Is big necessarily bad? In and among itself being big isn't necessarily bad but what we've seen is when companies become this dominant the sectors therein become less innovative or they stop creating new businesses and birthing new jobs. In Brazil and the U.S. the primary job creators are small and medium-sized businesses and there are fewer small businesses being started in these growth sectors because they are dominated by a monopoly or duopoly and it is difficult for them to get funded. People don't want to fund an e-commerce company or a search engine or a social media company. There's been no new social media company launched in the U.S. of any real size since 2011 with Pinterest so as you can see the sectors that these monopolies dominate tend to have fewer startups and begin to lose job creation whereas sectors that don't have a monopoly or duopoly don't have this concentration of power tend to birth more new companies and create more new jobs more new businesses more innovation and more tax revenue. Let's talk about Amazon. We have seen retail have a difficult year but it is beginning to rebound. COVID-19 has been an accelerant if you will for e-commerce. In the U.S. approximately 17 percent of all retail was done through digital channels in March of 2020. Within eight weeks after the outbreak of COVID it leapt to 27 percent. It had been growing approximately one percent a year so what you had was a decade of acceleration just in about eight weeks. You've also registered the same types of acceleration across mobile and e-commerce in Latin America. We've seen a dramatic catching up on e-commerce and adoption of mobile especially in Brazil which seems to be accelerating even faster and we've seen that Amazon however has been somewhat stunted in Brazil. I don't know if it's regulation or bureaucracy in the supply chain but Amazon so far hasn't been a disruptive force in Brazil. I wouldn't take that as comfort though because it does look as if Amazon is slowly but surely starting to turn its sights on Amazon. In the U.S. retail has been a difficult place to work or invest unless you work for a company in Seattle specifically Amazon and that is retail if you took Brazil excuse me if you took Amazon out of retail ETFs they've underperformed the market and almost all other sectors because essentially retail in the U.S. has kind of become a story of Amazon and the seven dwarfs. Amazon is now greater or worth more than the entire CPG industry so think about that the industry that's producing most of our consumer products if you take the entire industry it doesn't add up to the value that Amazon has created. What is Amazon's challenge moving forward? They're running into a lot of big numbers and that is if they want to maintain the trajectory of their stock price they're going to have to increase their top line revenues by almost a quarter of a trillion dollars. Again Amazon has to find another 250 billion dollars in top line revenue to maintain its growth. What does that mean? It means all roads lead to the same industry and that is healthcare. Amazon doesn't maybe want to go into healthcare but they have to. This is the largest industry in the western hemisphere it is incredibly ripe for disruption and Amazon has all the pieces in place to disrupt healthcare. They have a wearable that measures your body mass index they know what food you order they know what products you order they know your zip code whether you're in a monogamous relationship and they have the appliances to begin communicating with you and also begin gathering data. It's only a matter of time before you walk in and Alexa asks you if you would like insurance diagnostics or if your child has a rash you hold it up to an Alexa take a picture of it and then maybe they connect you with a pediatric dermatologist. I think Amazon will be the fastest growing healthcare company in the world if it isn't already. The thing about a monopoly is that when they come into a sector they can just announce they're entering and they begin gathering the mother's milk of business and that's access to cheap capital. So Amazon can get can take billions of dollars of market capitalization out of a sector just by announcing that they're going into the business. It's sort of a Jedi mind trick where they can just begin choking a competitor just by thinking ill of it. Let's talk about Apple. Apple typically trades at multiple of earnings somewhere between 10 and 15. It is now leapt to 37. Why? Because it has moved to subscription. Almost 20% of its revenues now come from subscription. This is a moment to pause and that is whatever business you're in you should be contemplating pilot projects try and move out of a transactional episodic type of business model retail consulting into a more recurring revenue membership subscription model similar to what Amazon did with Prime. Netflix's recurring revenue I believe Disney Plus is going to be a recurring revenue bundle if you will. Why is this important? When you go to a recurring revenue model you begin focusing on the relationship between the consumer and the company as opposed to putting your best minds and most capital into just getting more people into the store if you will. It changes the dynamic where you become more product and relationship focused. In addition the marketplace tends to value recurring revenue companies at a multiple of revenues as opposed to a multiple of EBITDA. So my challenge to every CEO I speak with is what pilot projects can you start to start transitioning to a recurring revenue model? And even if it's only 1% of your business as long as that part of your business is growing faster than the core business it begins to change the mentality and the way you think about the business and the marketplace begins to recast your business as having the potential to become the recurring revenue business. So that 20% of Apple's revenues that is subscription is driving the increase in its multiple. And as you can see if you find a company that stock price is dramatically increased or outpaced its revenue growth it's usually on the backs of a move to a recurring revenue business model. Apple's challenge is the same challenge as Amazon and that is they're running into the law of big numbers. They need to add a quarter of a trillion dollars. Where will they go? I thought last year I predicted that they were going to go into education but that doesn't appear to be happening. Where do I think Apple is going to go? Apple is going to go into a sector that previously was only a hundred billion dollar market capitalization sector until about two years ago and then it exploded to a seven hundred billion dollar sector. And I believe that pie is so big now that they can't ignore it. What is that sector? It is the automobile sector and that is I believe there is going to be a quarter of a trillion dollar event in the next 12 months and that event will be Tim Cook on stage unveiling an automobile, an electric automobile with an Apple logo on it. I think that day will set off a transition of a quarter or a transfer of a quarter of a trillion dollars from Tesla to Apple. I think Apple is the strongest brand in the world. It does an amazing job with hardware and I think a lot of people will be very interested in trialing an Apple car if you will. Facebook and Google have only gotten stronger. They used to control 60 cents on the digital dollar. We saw an incredible decline in advertising in the U.S. and in Brazil during COVID. It's returned and of course Google and Facebook have consolidated the market and they now have about 80 percent. TV, free TV still dominates in Brazil but we're seeing that the big players specifically Google and Facebook are starting to garner share and consolidate the market with incredible growth rates around programmatic and online advertising. In addition these companies can play offense when everyone else is playing defense. They have so much cash on hand. Any one of these companies could buy Boeing and Airbus just with the cash they have on hand. Now we're seeing some incredible externalities here and that is there is government overrun and that is these companies have become so powerful. In addition consumers love these products so much that they're seen as innovators and our leaders, our political leaders are somewhat remiss to apply the same standards to these companies as they've applied to other industries. The result is regulatory overrun. Two-thirds of men who joined extremist groups were done so after that group was suggested to them, actively suggested by Facebook or Google. I'd like to think that some immunities are kicking in and we're seeing around the world that organizations are saying we've had enough. For example in Brazil they implemented a top line tax because they decided that their tax lawyers were more sophisticated than your tax officials and they were sick of the massive tax avoidance. The same top line tax has been implemented in France. In the UK they decided that Uber can no longer circumvent minimum wage laws and we have antitrust or an antitrust movement here in the US and in Australia there's been regulation against Facebook. I'm going to switch gears to something that I think is an existential threat across some of our western economies. I call it the virgin homicides. What do I mean by that? Typically when an industry is digitized and that is there's a massive amount of innovation, new digital platforms that attracts cheap capital. There is a consolidation, there's a lot of innovation, a lot of new players and then there's actually a concentration of power that goes to the winner. Sort of a winner take most or winner take all. We saw it happen in media as we referenced Google and Facebook are now 80 cents on the digital dollar. We saw it in e-commerce. Amazon now represents in many markets 50 cents on the on the e-commerce dollar. We're now seeing it in mating and that is more and more people are meeting online. It's now the primary way that people meet potential mates or spouses is online. It's more through work, more through going out, more through school. Now what's wrong with that? The problem is with digitization you end up with again a winner take all and that is the Gini coefficient or the concentration is incredibly strong online. What do I mean by that? If there are 100 people on a dating app, four men, four men will get the majority of the interest from 46 of the 50 women leaving 46 men fighting over the attention of four women. Now what is the criteria for this? This is politically incorrect but the the data suggests this is that if a man can signal wealth online he garners a tremendous amount or a disproportionate amount of interest. So if you live in a higher income zip code, if you're able to express certification or college degrees, if you are dressed in expensive clothes you get dramatically more swipes than people who aren't able to communicate that type or express that type of wealth. Why is this a bad thing? So in the U.S. there was a study looking at in 2008 how many men under the age of under the age of 30 had never had sex and people hear the word sex and they start thinking a lot of different things but let's just think of sex as a key step to establishing a relationship. Only 8 percent, only 8 percent of men or had not had not had sex before the age of 30 in 2008. It has jumped to 28 percent. Almost one in three men in the United States have never been intimate with a woman under the age of 30. Now why is this bad? It's not based on values. It's not because they don't want to take that step. The reason it is bad is because the most dangerous person in the world is a young, broke, and lonely male. The most volatile, violent societies in the world have too many of this cohort and that is young men with very little to lose that have very few guardrails. They are not attaching to work, they are not attaching to school, and they are not attaching to a mate. That's not to say that young women who are lonely and can't find a job, that that isn't a problem, but they don't typically become violent or start revolutions. This leads to a variety of risky behavior. I think the adoption of meme stocks and to a certain extent crypto is based on young people who are pursuing volatility because for the first time at least in the U.S. a person at the age of 30 is no longer doing as well as their parents. This is the basis for revolution. The central compact of any society is that you will do better than your parents. When the majority of people, young people, aren't doing as well as the majority of their parents, it sets the stage for volatility and an incredible embrace of risk because they just have less to lose. This type of behavior or pent-up frustration leads to much more volatility even in the investment markets. Now we're seeing this across protests and that is not to say that these protests aren't righteous or the underlying movements aren't justified, but we're seeing an increase in participation. So for example, Vietnam protests, approximately 1% of the population in the United States had participated. It's almost 6% of the U.S. population has now participated in a protest in the U.S. The bottom line is if you have a job or you're in school you have less time to protest. We also see this translating to violence and that is in the U.S. we've had an epidemic of mass shootings and the profile of mass shooters is frighteningly similar. It's young men who are very lonely and feel totally detached socially. Now are there solutions? There are. We need more on-ramps to a middle-class life other than a traditional bachelor of arts and a lot of societies are beginning to prioritize and invest in vocational programs to give people the opportunity to have a middle-class life even if they're not able to get to college. So a prediction here, will 2021 be the best or the worst year in decades? I don't think the answer has been written. I think it's kind of up to us. You could see us coming out of this disaster stronger than ever. The fires in London spawned an incredible era of architecture. The end of World War II led us to make massive investments in Japan and Germany and turn them into tremendous allies such that it really largely kept the peace for the next 70 years. There are certain plants, pyrophilic plants that only germinate after a fire. At the same time this does appear to be bringing out some of the worst attributes in our tribal nature as a species. We politicize everything from masks and vaccines and we seem to have a lack of empathy around what's going on and we seem to be ignoring science at the cost of tremendous human suffering. So the economy has largely bounced back because of massive intervention and stimulus. We are seeing incredible GDP growth again. Even in Brazil it's estimated that we're going to see real significant GDP growth. We're also unfortunately seeing some of the same acceleration of current trends around income inequality. In the U.S. just one percent of the population garnered 90 percent of the gains post-COVID. We also have two people in the U.S. who are now wealthier than the bottom 40 percent and we see the same thing in Brazil where just six people have more wealth than half the nation. We're also seeing incredible income inequality within companies whereas the CEOs and top management have seen their salaries go up 14-fold whereas the average worker hasn't really had a raise in about 30 years. So wages have not caught up. We've seen incredible gains in productivity. There's always a tension between capital and labor and over the last 30 years capital quite frankly has been kicking the crap out of labor and that delta in that line between productivity and profits is trillions of dollars in shareholder value. The majority of that has gone back to shareholders and the top management. So if you think about a society loosely bucketed into three cohorts consumers, shareholders, and workers consumers are king. We now have the processing power of the space shuttle for free in our pockets. Shareholders have done well. The NASDAQ is up five-fold since 2008. It's workers that have had the toughest time and that is they have not seen not really seen a wage increase in over 30 years. There are some incredibly encouraging things around a decrease in the poverty rate specifically in the U.S. because of massive stimulus. We've seen the number of children living in poverty decline by 60 percent. The bottom quintile of households have seen their incomes increase by 20 or 30 percent. We're seeing it was temporary though in Brazil while the poverty rate declined dramatically during emergency aid. Now that some of that emergency aid has ended we're again seeing poverty rates start to escalate again. Obviously vaccines have been incredibly important and we're seeing certain nations do a better job of getting them out and others. Unfortunately in the U.S. vaccines have been politicized and we've seen an incredible drop off in the number of vaccines being administered in the U.S. and then the vaccine or excuse me the pathogen took advantage of this had time to morph had time to find new hosts times time to evolve to new variants and we now in the U.S. as we do in Brazil have a variant that is not only more infectious but just as virulent and in my home state of Florida we now have more children in pediatric ICU's than there are in many European countries. There's a narrative that always evolves that gives us comfort and one of those narratives was that this was not going to impact children and we're finding out in the U.S. that that's just not true. I have an 11 year old you're not allowed to get people vaccinated under the age of 12 and one of the reasons we are not in Florida is I will not take my 11 year old back to Florida who is unvaccinated because I believe our leadership has done such a terrible job of creating misinformation around vaccines and because so many people have decided not to get a vaccination. This flies in the face of everything we know about truth and about science and the bottom line is you're less likely to contract and less likely to spread COVID-19 with a vaccine and it's just incredibly discouraging. I'm a big fan of the Game of Thrones series and it's as if we we finally found Dragonstone something that can kill White Walkers but we decided not to use this Dragonstone. I think this presents a tremendous opportunity for the United States and that is we have incredible supply chain and can produce tremendous quantities of vaccine. If you think about World War II when tyranny reigned across Europe and threatened everywhere and it was going to threaten Latin America if Hitler had taken control of Europe he then probably would have landed in Latin America at some point. Our supply chain basically saved the world and that was we were able to produce more armaments. I think the similar opportunity is here and that is we have more opportunity to flood the world with vaccine than any other nation and I'd like to think the same generosity we demonstrated towards Japan and Germany we could demonstrate towards India and Brazil and that is to storm the shores of India and Brazil with vaccine and to reach out and grab the hands of our brothers and sisters and create new strong bonds and new allies that might stand the test of time over the next several decades. I'm going to end with a question around what is the profound opportunity coming out of the novel coronavirus. I don't think it's economic. There's a meaningful opportunity professionally and that is most auto races aren't one on the track they're one in the pits and that is if you can continue to run around the track while everyone else is in the pits you're going to win the race. Right now if you work for a company that offers you the technology and that company is financially doing well you are healthy you are emotionally fit and you are able to work at full capacity I think you should be working all the time. Why? My colleague at NYU Stern one of the brightest strategy professors in the world talks about the notion of variance and that is when there's huge variance that's where you want to invest. So for example if everybody in your industry has great branch networks that's not where you invest but if there's huge variance in their ability to data mine that's where you want to invest. Right now there's huge variance in corporate Brazil and corporate America and that is a lot of people are able to work at full productivity but a lot of people are not for different reasons. That is when you want to work really hard. I think there's an opportunity to lap the competition if you will right now if your company is blessed with the resources and you are emotionally financially and professionally fit if you will. I think this is a tremendous opportunity to make progress because a lot of the competition is stuck in the pits if you will. That is a meaningful opportunity. However, however the profound opportunity is for the repair and cementing of key relationships. I wrote a book on happiness because I struggle with my own happiness. My blessings are here my happiness is here and I wanted to bring this and more in line with this. So happiness is similar to any sport. If you want to be great at soccer you have to practice and I think if you want to be great at happiness you have to study the concept and practice it. The key to being happy across almost every study every ethnicity and every geography is the number of deep and meaningful relationships you have. At work do you feel respected and admired and do you respect and admire other people? Amongst your friends you get a sense of joy and camaraderie and do you know they know that you feel a sense of joy and camaraderie and also across your family do you feel an intense level of love and support and just as importantly do you know they know that they are intensely loved and supported by you. So the profound opportunity is during a crisis is the repair and cementing of relationships and that is people remember how you behave during a crisis. We give medals and ribbons to our young men and women in uniform based on their ability to show grace and courage and love during a crisis. We are in a crisis. People remember how you behave in a crisis. So three questions and I end every presentation I'm giving. I will present over 300,000 people this year and I end every presentation with the same three questions. Question one is this an opportunity to pivot to becoming a caregiver for someone older in your life? A parent, an uncle, someone who is struggling mentally or physically with the novel coronavirus. It's easy for us to expect care from our parents. Is this that moment to pivot to being their parent if you will too? Do you have the relationship with your siblings that you want? If you had been one of the people that was forced to say goodbye to your sibling who was in the emergency room over FaceTime is your relationship where you want it to be? And then finally have you made the requisite investments in friendships to maintain those friendships or have you let perceived slights or competitiveness or other bullshit get in the way of those friendships? The key to our happiness is the number of deep and meaningful relationships and the novel coronavirus presents us with a tremendous opportunity if you are blessed with health, financial security, and grace to repair and cement those relationships. A meaningful opportunity professionally, a profound opportunity for the repair and cementing of key relationships. Let's summarize. We are experiencing decades and days. The novel coronavirus's enduring feature will be seen as an accelerant more than a change agent whether it's the number of people living at home, whether it's income inequality, whether it's telehealth, whether it's dispersion of financial markets. All the existing trends are just accelerating. An interesting question to ask yourself take every trend professionally and personally and take it out 10 years and ask yourself are we here right now and if so how would you change your business strategy and how would you change your own personal approach to your own relationships? Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google continue to their march. I believe that they have overrun government and are a threat to our society and they should be broken up. We have an emerging crisis among young men who are not attaching to work, not attaching to school, and not attaching to relationships and I believe that we are on the precipice of what could be the best or the worst year in the last several decades but I don't think it's an organic decision. I think it's up to us and I think the profound opportunity is to demonstrate grace, forgiveness, and generosity during a crisis and we are in a crisis. The profound opportunity again is to invest in and repair and cement key relationships. My name is Scott Galloway. I teach at NYU. I'll stop right there and I'll open it up for questions and answers. Thank you Scott. That was amazing. Thanks for your presentation. This is Fernando here. If I may start with the question, I'm an avid listener of your podcast, the Prof. G show. The few times that I'm able to go to the gym I always listen to it and one of your earlier predictions regarding the big tech firms was that they need to be broken up, right? They are too powerful and you talk about that, that they need to be separated at some sorts or there needs to be more regulation on those companies. We've seen China going through that route in recent weeks and months so I just wanted to see what are your thoughts regarding what China is doing and what the US can or will do in the future with regards to regulation of the big tech firms? Thanks for the question. I've been thinking a lot about this. Americans are some of the most, I think we are an exceptionally innovative, generous people. We're also, our comorbidity is our arrogance and that is we believe that the American way is so far superior we don't even like to learn from other nations and I think there's a lot to be learned from what is going on in China right now. China over the last 30 years has brought three quarters of a billion people out of poverty so I'm not a fan of China. You could argue they're engaged in kind of genocide, autocracy, but there's just no getting around it. Bringing 750 million people out of poverty is one of the greatest accomplishments in the history of mankind so to not learn from the Chinese is to basically decide to put your head in the sand and what can we learn? The Chinese have looked across the Pacific at the United States and said we are not going to subvert societal interest economic interests and they decided to essentially take some of these iconic companies that seem to be engaged in economic or government overrun and they have severely curtailed their power and they're talking about breaking them up. They have taken online tutoring companies that were helping the children of rich families get into the best colleges and they have said no more of that. They are worried about income inequality. They are worried about companies or families building dynasties. They have decided that they are going to force video game companies to limit the amount of time the young people spend on video games and social networks. So when you look at what they've done essentially they have looked at the U.S. and said that the U.S. is heading down a dangerous path of too much corporate concentration, a lack of regard for the mental well-being of young people, and the emergence of income inequality through dynastic wealth through education that's only accessible to the children of rich people. I think that is very interesting and I think we should not, I'm not suggesting we adopt their kind of hard-handed tactics, but I think it's interesting to look at China which plays the long game and has been more successful than any nation relatively speaking economically over the last 30 years and to understand or register what they see as being the biggest mistakes in the United States. So I think there's a lot to learn there. I personally don't think that these companies, I think they're going to wrap their knuckles but I don't think they're going to cut their fingers off. I personally think that these internet companies are really good investments right now. For example, Alibaba, which is the Amazon of Asia trades at a forward price earnings multiple of about 17 versus Amazon trades at 60 despite the fact that Alibaba is growing faster than Amazon. So basically when you buy Alibaba you're buying Amazon for a third of the price because there's such a chill and there's such a concern that China is going to withdraw from the capital markets and that any investment in these companies is going to be stranded. I don't think that's the case. I think the Chinese are effectively sent a very strong signal of these companies but they're not going to shut them down. So I think China offers an opportunity for us to learn by seeing how they see the U.S. I do believe the U.S. is going to break up big tech. We have a tendency to think that it's bad for capitalism. If you look at most breakups the shareholders win. So for example, PayPal used to be part of eBay. It's now worth dramatically more than eBay. Spends typically work. When AT&T, our biggest telco, was broken up in the 80s here in the U.S. each of the seven companies the baby bells that was broken up into ended up being worth more than the original AT&T with just 10 years. So I don't think we break up these companies necessarily because they're bad people or some sort of punishment but because breaking them up is a key component of oxygenating the economy. So I think the breakup is coming and I think it'll be good for the stock market, good for investors, good for job growth, good for the planet. Thank you so much. Who wants to go next? Okay sure. So thank you for your brilliant presentation professor. I guess I've also become a fan of your podcast and I've heard on a couple of different occasions you mention a very interesting a bit polemic view I would say for some especially at these times in terms of what young people should focus when they think about what to do with their lives in career-wise I would say and I say I quote here something that I heard in your podcast, find your talent, don't find your passion. So I personally think this is an amazing view. I've been a fan of doing that. I've been trying to do that for my whole life but most people say I'm a bit crazy so I was very happy to hear someone as brilliant as you say something like that. I don't know could you could you say a bit further and share your views on this? Thanks for being kind. So at the business school we're very fortunate we get guest speakers almost every day and generally there's two types of speakers. Someone who is very impressive and very accomplished or a billionaire. In the U.S. we've decided anyone that reaches a billion dollars in wealth has insight into life and they always end their speech with what I think is just terrible advice and they say follow your passion and it's somewhat ironic because typically the person telling you to follow your passion made their billions in iron ore smelting or health care maintenance. Typically I think as a young person you should be wary that anyone who tells you to follow your passion is already rich and I wanted to be an athlete, a professional athlete growing up and I learned very quickly that that was not where my talent lied and so I tried to find something I was good at and I think your job as a young person is to find something you're good at and then to invest the requisite grit, thousands of hours enduring hardship, enduring failure, enduring frustration. That's called work and then become great at it and when you become great at something the accoutrements of being great at it money, economic security, prestige, camaraderie, self-worth, all of those things will make you passionate about whatever it is. Nobody grows up passionate about tax law but the best tax lawyers in the world fly private and have a much broader selection set of mates than they deserve which makes them passionate about tax law. So do your passions on weekends, be a DJ, play soccer on weekends but find something that you could be the best in the world at. That's your job. That's your job. Arthur? Hi Scott. Going back to your sector which is education, you showed the chart between profits and wages, right? Let's face it, the majority of the world is going to be workers, right? I mean does it mean that we have had a massive failure of educational systems that are not able to keep up with technology and can we change that going forward? I do think there's been a failure amongst myself and my cohorts and that is we no longer see ourselves as, Arthur, as public servants. We see ourselves as luxury brands and that is, so when I went to UCLA the admittance rate was 70% meaning if 100 people applied 70 got in and I had to apply twice to get in and the cost was approximately a thousand dollars a year. This year the admittance rate will be 9% and the cost is $35,000 a year which means that I wouldn't be here. I'm not a humble person. I think I'm exceptionally talented but the reason I'm here speaking to you from Nantucket and getting to do wonderful things with my life and provide economic security for my family is because back in the 80s we used to let in unremarkable kids into college and they let in the sons of single immigrant mothers who lived and died as secretary which was my mother. We never had a household income more than $35,000 a year. The U.S. education system and to a certain extent the global education system used to be about finding good people and giving them great opportunities. In the U.S. we've now become Hermes and that is we think our job is not to find good kids and give them great opportunities but our job is to find the top 1% and turn them into billionaires. That's not the purpose of an economy. The key to any economy is to give unremarkable people remarkable opportunities so I think we need to fall back in love with the unremarkables. Harvard got 55,000 applications this year and they let in 1,400 students. This despite the fact they sit on an endowment that's the GDP of El Salvador. They could let in 14,000 people not sacrifice any quality and they'd have the resources so the question is well why wouldn't they? And a lot of us brag I don't know if you've done this a lot of us brag about we say I would never get into the college I went into I went to I would never be admitted. Well don't brag about that because that means your daughter's not getting in. So we in public education need to fall back in love with the unremarkables and stop thinking of ourselves as Chanel and Hermes and go back to a world where we are public servants. The children of rich people they're the ones that don't need college. They have a great education up until that point. They have connections. They have money. They have a safety net. They have access to capital. It's the people we're not letting in that need college the most so we need to fall back in love with unremarkables. We need to go back to a viewpoint that education is not a luxury brand that we're public servants and we need to massively massively increase enrollment rates and decrease costs through a mix of small and big tech and me and my cohorts need to be recognized that we are not luxury brands we are public servants we have totally lost the script. Higher education in the U.S. has become the enforcer of the caste system. It used to be an incredible upward lubricant and we need to return to those roots. Well unfortunately our timing is coming to an end so on the name of XP I'd like to thank you very much Scott for being here with us for your fantastic presentation for everything you do. Hopefully we can get you here on the ground next year when this event goes back to being live hopefully knock on wood but thank you so much. Thank you best best of wishes greetings everybody. Thank you Raquel and for everyone who followed us in this conversation and don't miss the next expert's lectures because the expert is just starting. you
