 My prediction is this time next year, TikTok is a publicly traded company that is whose majority of governance and asset holders are U.S. based. I do believe that the CCP is going to decide that they'd rather hold on to $300 billion than lose 300 billion and lose this propaganda. They're losing the propaganda weapon that is TikTok. I think that's happening based on what I've seen in the hearing so far. And I think on the eve of the banning or maybe into the first implementation of it, they decided they'd come to some sort of agreement to spend the asset.
