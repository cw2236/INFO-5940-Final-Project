1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
I think Twitter is sort of the pre-shock to the earthquake,

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,960
and that is I think this virus of reckless behavior

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,560
has jumped or escaped the lab of Twitter

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,040
and is now infecting Tesla.

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,560
Tesla's brand equity has declined dramatically.

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,720
And when you look at that coupled with dramatic new

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,520
entrants in the EV space, I think

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,360
you could see Tesla shed the equivalent of seven Twitters.

9
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:26,000
I think Tesla could go from $600 billion to $300 billion

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,120
very easily with this decline in brand equity.

11
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,440
So I think the real story here is the decline in Tesla's value

12
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,520
because of Elon's activities at Twitter.
