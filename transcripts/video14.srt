1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
Give me your prediction for the debate.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,720
I'm not watching it, which is because, just to be blunt,

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,000
I think chances are he's going to do better than people think.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,160
Her medium is being on an elevated podium

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,120
with questions prepped by staff.

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,000
And basically, she's playing what she was, district attorney

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,520
slash attorney general.

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,480
I don't think she's as good on her feet as he is.

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,360
I'm hoping that he continues to show signs of being

10
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,200
addled and cognitive decline.

11
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,040
I gotta be honest, Kara, I'm really worried about it.

12
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,640
I think the expectations around her momentum have become too high.

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,080
I think he's good on his feet.

14
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,280
So I just can't watch it.

15
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,280
I'm too nervous about it.

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,760
The other thing is he could appear too quiet, like too...

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,800
They want happy Trump, but there's also comatose Trump.

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,240
You've seen it before, right?

19
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,680
He did it at the economic club, that kind of Trump.

20
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,080
And that shows lack of energy, so he seems old.

21
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,000
That is his problem.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,040
She's just got to be as sharp as a fucking tack.

23
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,960
She really does.

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,400
The one piece of advice I would have for the Harris campaign would be

25
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,880
stop falling into the same trap Democrats have been falling into

26
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,920
for the last two years.

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,920
And that is we spend all of our capital and energy talking about

28
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,920
why he would be bad for America.

29
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,840
She needs to totally focus on why she would be good for America.

30
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,840
She needs to show a series of policies she needs to come across as,

31
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,640
in my view, a little bit wonky.

32
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,000
It has to be, I got my hands on the wheel.
