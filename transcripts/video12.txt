 The prediction is the following. By November the 7th or 10th, let's assume this election is going to be challenged by everybody. Between now and November the 10th, Donald Trump media, which I think is around 30 bucks, will either be below 10 or above 80. This thing has become a literally the tail of the whip on the prospects of Donald Trump recapturing the White House. The most volatile stock over the next few weeks is going to be Donald Trump media, which attempts to absorb a million points of light and guess as to whether he's going to be in the White House. This thing, 30 now, it's going to be below 10 or above 80 within three weeks. I find it just super interesting. It's literally, in my opinion, it's a more robust poll than Quinnipac.
