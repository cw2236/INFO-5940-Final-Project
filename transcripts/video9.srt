1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
Thanks for having me. My name is Scott Galloway. I teach at NYU and I appreciate your time today.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:11,600
I'm coming to you live from a small a small sandbar in the Atlantic called Nantucket. Over the course

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:19,840
of the next 35 minutes I'll be taking you through approximately 130 slides and then hopefully we'll

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:28,400
leave time for 10 minutes of Q&A. So with that let's bust right into it. So we're going to talk

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,920
about COVID's enduring feature as more of an accelerant than a change agent. We'll also look

6
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,840
at some of these changes through the lens of the companies I spend the most time thinking about

7
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:44,400
Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google. We'll talk about an emerging crisis among young men and some

8
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:51,360
predictions for 2021 and then what we believe is the profound opportunity. Some disclosures, I have

9
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,200
investment stakes or ownerships in the following private and public companies. So just in terms of

10
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:03,600
if I sound as if I am promoting a company I probably am but these are the firms that I have

11
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,680
economic stakes in. Okay decades and days. There's a great quote attributed to Lenin that says

12
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,760
there are decades where nothing happens and there are weeks where decades happen. I think we're in

13
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,920
the former and that is we tend to think of time as a function of these astrophysical objects

14
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,760
circling a hot plasma called the sun but as humans we register time as a function of change and it

15
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,760
seems as if time is accelerating if you will. In the U.S. to give you a scale of the crisis here

16
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:37,440
just in one month last April we lost more Americans than we lost in the entire Vietnam conflict

17
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:43,040
and the numbers get even more staggering. At one point we were losing the same number of American

18
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:50,400
souls we lost in the attacks of 9-11 every 17 hours in the U.S. Obviously in Brazil and in India

19
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:56,720
we have seen the same type of mortality rates and is arguably the greatest public health crisis in

20
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,440
the last century. There's no easy way to segue to business. I'll just segue to business.

21
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,400
There have been three big shifts in our economy our modern economy. The first is globalization

22
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,520
comparative advantage. The second digitization simply put the internet and then I think we're

23
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,920
on the precipice of a third big shift in our modern economy and that is dispersion. What do

24
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,440
we mean by dispersion? So the ability to distribute products or services from the source creator to

25
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,800
the end user the end stakeholder reshaping the supply chain such that the source creator gets

26
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,720
greater margins and the end user gets to access the product with less friction or lower cost.

27
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,560
I think of it almost as leapfrogging right whether it's Peloton leapfrogging the gym

28
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,680
whether it's Wonder Woman 1984 coming directly to your TV in your home as opposed to having to go

29
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:52,240
to a theater whether it's Zoom bringing us to bringing work letting you rent your human capital

30
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:57,120
to an organization leapfrogging an office building or whether it's what we're doing now where we can

31
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,880
leapfrog the physical infrastructure of a conference and go directly to the end consumer. We're seeing

32
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:08,480
this dispersion of value if you will in a reshaping of the supply chain across almost every industry

33
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,800
and I think that presents tremendous opportunities and tremendous challenges and what will probably

34
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,680
be the greatest reshuffling of stakeholder value since the introduction of the internet.

35
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,080
The biggest industry that will be most impacted by this is healthcare and that is the healthcare

36
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,240
industrial complex is being dispersed. What do I mean by that? Probably 99 plus of the people who

37
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,080
have contracted endured and developed antibodies for the novel coronavirus will have never entered

38
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:40,000
a hospital much less a doctor's office. The number of people who were seeing doctors virtually has

39
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,320
absolutely exploded. It was less than one percent pre-pandemic it's almost a third now of visits are

40
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:52,480
done virtually. That will go down once the pandemic has subsided but it's not going back to one percent.

41
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,240
We've seen a similar phenomenon in Brazil where we've seen an explosion in telehealth. We're also

42
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:03,440
going to see a dispersion in education and that is in my industry we've used admissions departments

43
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:09,680
and the physical limits of a campus to gate or constrain artificially in my view the supply

44
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,400
of seats at great universities. I think a lot of the intellectual property and certification is

45
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,000
being dispersed to remote appliances such that we can expand hopefully expand the offering and

46
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,120
education can be dispersed. In the U.S. it's a 750 billion dollar business globally it's a two

47
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,880
trillion dollar business. Why is there such a rush to disperse education? Because my industry has

48
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,920
raised prices faster than almost any other industry maybe with the exception of healthcare. Tuition in

49
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:42,640
the U.S. is up 1400 percent in the last 30 years. To give you a sense of just how outrageous the

50
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,280
pricing has become I teach a course called brand strategy at the NYU Stern School of Business.

51
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,520
Every student has to spend seven thousand dollars U.S. to take my course not for the year that's

52
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,440
just to take my one course. I have 280 students in my class in the fall or put another way my

53
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:06,480
course generates approximately 1.96 million dollars just that one course. Now think about this I have

54
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,720
returned my compensation to the school for the last 10 years so I can continue to bite the hand

55
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,560
that doesn't feed me but try and imagine another product that gets a two million dollar price tag

56
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,960
with 98 points maybe 99 points of gross margin. The only other product I could find is a product

57
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,320
called Zolgensma which is a life-saving gene therapy that is literally a knockout drug. Two

58
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:36,000
doses of this cures a rare genetic disease so either cure save your life or brand strategy

59
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,520
with Professor Scott Galloway. I don't think either of those is sustainable. We're going to see

60
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,320
incredible dispersion of media. We use the example of media going straight to our smartphones or our

61
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:52,160
speakers and skipping not only the supply chain of movie theaters but skipping the traditional

62
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,520
arbiters of what gets greenlit. You can go on YouTube now you can go on TikTok and you can garner

63
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,360
a huge following without the permission or the green light from a studio executive or an agent.

64
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,040
Theaters are obviously being massively disrupted here in the U.S. When we think about media there's

65
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:14,800
really only two media formats that are growing over the top streaming and video games. Every other

66
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,800
media is suffering and losing oxygen if you will. We're also seeing an incredible dispersion in

67
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:27,440
finance and that is where disruption is typically a disruptor if you will or a new player comes in

68
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,880
and starts focusing on a market that's been overlooked because the incumbents see them as

69
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,720
unprofitable. An example of this in Argentina would be Walla that is going after the 50 percent

70
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,680
of Argentinians that don't have a bank account. Neobank in Brazil we are seeing incredible

71
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:47,040
disruption where people are going after these companies have access to cheap capital,

72
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:52,560
leveraging smartphones, leveraging technology and building from the ground up a cohort that

73
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:59,120
had previously been ignored. The result is the marketplace loves these disruptors and provides

74
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,320
them with valuations greater than the incumbents. So look at this PayPal is worth dramatically more

75
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:09,600
than Goldman Sachs and Square will soon be worth more than Morgan Stanley. These are financial

76
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,320
institutions that took generations some even centuries to build and these disruptors are

77
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:20,560
already have already garnered more stakeholder value. Crypto is a dispersion of trust from

78
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,960
central banks to new assets and also a younger generation that doesn't believe the current asset

79
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,000
classes are serving them well. When we have bailouts that prop up the markets there's a

80
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,080
general feeling among people under the age of 30 that they have to create their own asset classes

81
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,720
to have the same opportunities that their parents had and you're seeing tremendous traction

82
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,360
of these asset classes and adoption across institutions and retail. In the U.S. there are

83
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,560
now just as many people of color in the investment markets as whites mostly because they have engaged

84
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,640
with new trading apps and also they're interested in cryptocurrencies. So we talk about this in the

85
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:03,920
context of opportunity but there's also some very serious societal concerns specifically dispersion

86
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:10,400
if you will is kind of the evil cousin of segregation and that is when we no longer go to the mall the

87
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,800
movie theater or even to work we interact less often with people from different races and different

88
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,400
income classes and we lose empathy when we no longer see the homeless veteran the homeless person

89
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,560
the single mother at the mall the grocery store the movie theater we have less empathy for them.

90
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,920
There's been studies showing that when a minority group grows in population if you live near them

91
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:36,640
you have empathy for them if you do not live near them and they are segregated you begin to resent

92
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:42,880
them. Let's talk a little bit about the four. We are seeing these companies now have the power

93
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,840
and I believe the influence of nation states. I believe Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google are

94
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,960
singularly more powerful and influential than almost any entities in the world maybe the

95
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:57,680
exception of China in the U.S. and if you look at their market capitalizations and I realize it's

96
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:03,040
apples to oranges they have a greater economic value or market capitalization than the GDP of

97
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,720
several large nations. They are also becoming so dominant that they are beginning to soak up all

98
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:15,840
the oxygen in the markets. Just five companies now represent a quarter of all the value of the S&P 500

99
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:21,360
and we're seeing tremendous increase in market capitalization. They have absolutely accelerated

100
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,240
the pandemic they have gained power they have increased their market capitalization.

101
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:32,480
Think about this one company Apple is worth more than the hundred biggest companies in the

102
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,000
United Kingdom combined so essentially we have one firm that is bigger than the biggest companies

103
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:45,760
in a large economy. Now why is this bad? Is big necessarily bad? In and among itself being big

104
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,200
isn't necessarily bad but what we've seen is when companies become this dominant the sectors therein

105
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:57,040
become less innovative or they stop creating new businesses and birthing new jobs. In Brazil and

106
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,480
the U.S. the primary job creators are small and medium-sized businesses and there are fewer small

107
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,640
businesses being started in these growth sectors because they are dominated by a monopoly or duopoly

108
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,840
and it is difficult for them to get funded. People don't want to fund an e-commerce company or a

109
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:18,480
search engine or a social media company. There's been no new social media company launched in the

110
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:25,280
U.S. of any real size since 2011 with Pinterest so as you can see the sectors that these monopolies

111
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:31,840
dominate tend to have fewer startups and begin to lose job creation whereas sectors that don't have

112
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:37,920
a monopoly or duopoly don't have this concentration of power tend to birth more new companies and

113
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:44,080
create more new jobs more new businesses more innovation and more tax revenue. Let's talk about

114
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:51,200
Amazon. We have seen retail have a difficult year but it is beginning to rebound. COVID-19 has been

115
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,960
an accelerant if you will for e-commerce. In the U.S. approximately 17 percent of all retail was

116
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:02,240
done through digital channels in March of 2020. Within eight weeks after the outbreak of COVID it

117
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:08,960
leapt to 27 percent. It had been growing approximately one percent a year so what you had was a

118
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:15,600
decade of acceleration just in about eight weeks. You've also registered the same types of acceleration

119
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:22,160
across mobile and e-commerce in Latin America. We've seen a dramatic catching up on e-commerce

120
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:29,280
and adoption of mobile especially in Brazil which seems to be accelerating even faster and we've

121
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:34,560
seen that Amazon however has been somewhat stunted in Brazil. I don't know if it's regulation

122
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:40,160
or bureaucracy in the supply chain but Amazon so far hasn't been a disruptive force in Brazil.

123
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,520
I wouldn't take that as comfort though because it does look as if Amazon is slowly but surely

124
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:51,760
starting to turn its sights on Amazon. In the U.S. retail has been a difficult place to work or

125
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:57,600
invest unless you work for a company in Seattle specifically Amazon and that is retail if you took

126
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,720
Brazil excuse me if you took Amazon out of retail ETFs they've underperformed the market

127
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,240
and almost all other sectors because essentially retail in the U.S. has kind of become a story of

128
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:14,560
Amazon and the seven dwarfs. Amazon is now greater or worth more than the entire CPG industry so

129
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,040
think about that the industry that's producing most of our consumer products if you take the

130
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,160
entire industry it doesn't add up to the value that Amazon has created. What is Amazon's challenge

131
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,480
moving forward? They're running into a lot of big numbers and that is if they want to maintain the

132
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,480
trajectory of their stock price they're going to have to increase their top line revenues by almost

133
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:38,320
a quarter of a trillion dollars. Again Amazon has to find another 250 billion dollars in top line

134
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:45,360
revenue to maintain its growth. What does that mean? It means all roads lead to the same industry

135
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,360
and that is healthcare. Amazon doesn't maybe want to go into healthcare but they have to. This is

136
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:57,440
the largest industry in the western hemisphere it is incredibly ripe for disruption and Amazon has

137
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:03,200
all the pieces in place to disrupt healthcare. They have a wearable that measures your body mass

138
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,960
index they know what food you order they know what products you order they know your zip code

139
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:11,520
whether you're in a monogamous relationship and they have the appliances to begin communicating

140
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:17,440
with you and also begin gathering data. It's only a matter of time before you walk in and Alexa asks

141
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:24,000
you if you would like insurance diagnostics or if your child has a rash you hold it up to an Alexa

142
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,040
take a picture of it and then maybe they connect you with a pediatric dermatologist. I think Amazon

143
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,800
will be the fastest growing healthcare company in the world if it isn't already. The thing about a

144
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,840
monopoly is that when they come into a sector they can just announce they're entering and they

145
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:46,320
begin gathering the mother's milk of business and that's access to cheap capital. So Amazon can get

146
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,120
can take billions of dollars of market capitalization out of a sector just by announcing

147
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,600
that they're going into the business. It's sort of a Jedi mind trick where they can just begin

148
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:03,280
choking a competitor just by thinking ill of it. Let's talk about Apple. Apple typically trades at

149
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:10,640
multiple of earnings somewhere between 10 and 15. It is now leapt to 37. Why? Because it has moved

150
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:18,480
to subscription. Almost 20% of its revenues now come from subscription. This is a moment to pause

151
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:24,080
and that is whatever business you're in you should be contemplating pilot projects try and move out

152
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:30,800
of a transactional episodic type of business model retail consulting into a more recurring

153
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:36,160
revenue membership subscription model similar to what Amazon did with Prime. Netflix's recurring

154
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,280
revenue I believe Disney Plus is going to be a recurring revenue bundle if you will. Why is this

155
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:46,320
important? When you go to a recurring revenue model you begin focusing on the relationship between

156
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,600
the consumer and the company as opposed to putting your best minds and most capital into just getting

157
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,320
more people into the store if you will. It changes the dynamic where you become more product and

158
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:01,600
relationship focused. In addition the marketplace tends to value recurring revenue companies at a

159
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,640
multiple of revenues as opposed to a multiple of EBITDA. So my challenge to every CEO I speak with

160
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:12,320
is what pilot projects can you start to start transitioning to a recurring revenue model?

161
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,520
And even if it's only 1% of your business as long as that part of your business is growing faster

162
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:22,400
than the core business it begins to change the mentality and the way you think about the business

163
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,400
and the marketplace begins to recast your business as having the potential

164
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:32,080
to become the recurring revenue business. So that 20% of Apple's revenues that is subscription

165
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:37,760
is driving the increase in its multiple. And as you can see if you find a company that stock

166
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:44,000
price is dramatically increased or outpaced its revenue growth it's usually on the backs of a

167
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,880
move to a recurring revenue business model. Apple's challenge is the same challenge as Amazon and that

168
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,200
is they're running into the law of big numbers. They need to add a quarter of a trillion dollars.

169
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,920
Where will they go? I thought last year I predicted that they were going to go into education but that

170
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,840
doesn't appear to be happening. Where do I think Apple is going to go? Apple is going to go into

171
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:09,360
a sector that previously was only a hundred billion dollar market capitalization sector

172
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:15,200
until about two years ago and then it exploded to a seven hundred billion dollar sector. And I believe

173
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:21,200
that pie is so big now that they can't ignore it. What is that sector? It is the automobile sector

174
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:26,080
and that is I believe there is going to be a quarter of a trillion dollar event in the next

175
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:31,920
12 months and that event will be Tim Cook on stage unveiling an automobile, an electric automobile

176
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:37,920
with an Apple logo on it. I think that day will set off a transition of a quarter or a transfer

177
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:43,600
of a quarter of a trillion dollars from Tesla to Apple. I think Apple is the strongest brand in the

178
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,320
world. It does an amazing job with hardware and I think a lot of people will be very interested in

179
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,600
trialing an Apple car if you will. Facebook and Google have only gotten stronger. They used to

180
00:16:53,600 --> 00:17:00,960
control 60 cents on the digital dollar. We saw an incredible decline in advertising in the U.S. and

181
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:06,880
in Brazil during COVID. It's returned and of course Google and Facebook have consolidated the market

182
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:13,200
and they now have about 80 percent. TV, free TV still dominates in Brazil but we're seeing that the

183
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:18,480
big players specifically Google and Facebook are starting to garner share and consolidate the market

184
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:24,560
with incredible growth rates around programmatic and online advertising. In addition these companies

185
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:30,240
can play offense when everyone else is playing defense. They have so much cash on hand. Any one

186
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:37,920
of these companies could buy Boeing and Airbus just with the cash they have on hand. Now we're

187
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,560
seeing some incredible externalities here and that is there is government overrun and that is

188
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:49,200
these companies have become so powerful. In addition consumers love these products so much

189
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,400
that they're seen as innovators and our leaders, our political leaders are somewhat remiss to apply

190
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,360
the same standards to these companies as they've applied to other industries. The result is regulatory

191
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:06,640
overrun. Two-thirds of men who joined extremist groups were done so after that group was suggested

192
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:13,440
to them, actively suggested by Facebook or Google. I'd like to think that some immunities are kicking

193
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,520
in and we're seeing around the world that organizations are saying we've had enough. For

194
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,240
example in Brazil they implemented a top line tax because they decided that their tax lawyers

195
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,480
were more sophisticated than your tax officials and they were sick of the massive tax avoidance.

196
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:32,480
The same top line tax has been implemented in France. In the UK they decided that Uber can no

197
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:38,080
longer circumvent minimum wage laws and we have antitrust or an antitrust movement here in the US

198
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:44,560
and in Australia there's been regulation against Facebook. I'm going to switch gears to something

199
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:49,520
that I think is an existential threat across some of our western economies. I call it the virgin

200
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:55,840
homicides. What do I mean by that? Typically when an industry is digitized and that is there's a

201
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:02,480
massive amount of innovation, new digital platforms that attracts cheap capital. There is a consolidation,

202
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,560
there's a lot of innovation, a lot of new players and then there's actually a concentration of power

203
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:11,840
that goes to the winner. Sort of a winner take most or winner take all. We saw it happen in media

204
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:18,080
as we referenced Google and Facebook are now 80 cents on the digital dollar. We saw it in

205
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:24,720
e-commerce. Amazon now represents in many markets 50 cents on the on the e-commerce dollar. We're

206
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:32,320
now seeing it in mating and that is more and more people are meeting online. It's now the

207
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:39,440
primary way that people meet potential mates or spouses is online. It's more through work, more

208
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:45,360
through going out, more through school. Now what's wrong with that? The problem is with digitization

209
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:52,000
you end up with again a winner take all and that is the Gini coefficient or the concentration is

210
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,040
incredibly strong online. What do I mean by that? If there are 100 people on a dating app,

211
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:06,240
four men, four men will get the majority of the interest from 46 of the 50 women leaving 46 men

212
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:12,480
fighting over the attention of four women. Now what is the criteria for this? This is politically

213
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:20,240
incorrect but the the data suggests this is that if a man can signal wealth online he garners a

214
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,840
tremendous amount or a disproportionate amount of interest. So if you live in a higher income zip

215
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:32,640
code, if you're able to express certification or college degrees, if you are dressed in expensive

216
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,160
clothes you get dramatically more swipes than people who aren't able to communicate that type

217
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:45,280
or express that type of wealth. Why is this a bad thing? So in the U.S. there was a study looking at

218
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:52,080
in 2008 how many men under the age of under the age of 30 had never had sex and people hear the

219
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:57,120
word sex and they start thinking a lot of different things but let's just think of sex as a key step

220
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:07,360
to establishing a relationship. Only 8 percent, only 8 percent of men or had not had not had sex

221
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:14,640
before the age of 30 in 2008. It has jumped to 28 percent. Almost one in three men in the United

222
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:20,480
States have never been intimate with a woman under the age of 30. Now why is this bad? It's not based

223
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:26,000
on values. It's not because they don't want to take that step. The reason it is bad is because the

224
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
most dangerous person in the world is a young, broke, and lonely male. The most volatile, violent

225
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,040
societies in the world have too many of this cohort and that is young men with very little to lose that

226
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:44,160
have very few guardrails. They are not attaching to work, they are not attaching to school, and they

227
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:50,000
are not attaching to a mate. That's not to say that young women who are lonely and can't find a job,

228
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,200
that that isn't a problem, but they don't typically become violent or start revolutions.

229
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:01,360
This leads to a variety of risky behavior. I think the adoption of meme stocks and to a

230
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:07,680
certain extent crypto is based on young people who are pursuing volatility because for the first time

231
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:13,840
at least in the U.S. a person at the age of 30 is no longer doing as well as their parents.

232
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:20,000
This is the basis for revolution. The central compact of any society is that you will do better

233
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,240
than your parents. When the majority of people, young people, aren't doing as well as the majority

234
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:30,720
of their parents, it sets the stage for volatility and an incredible embrace of risk because they just

235
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:38,080
have less to lose. This type of behavior or pent-up frustration leads to much more volatility

236
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:44,880
even in the investment markets. Now we're seeing this across protests and that is not to say that

237
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,680
these protests aren't righteous or the underlying movements aren't justified, but we're seeing an

238
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:55,520
increase in participation. So for example, Vietnam protests, approximately 1% of the population in

239
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:01,280
the United States had participated. It's almost 6% of the U.S. population has now participated in

240
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,520
a protest in the U.S. The bottom line is if you have a job or you're in school you have less time

241
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:12,160
to protest. We also see this translating to violence and that is in the U.S. we've had an

242
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:18,240
epidemic of mass shootings and the profile of mass shooters is frighteningly similar. It's young men

243
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,560
who are very lonely and feel totally detached socially. Now are there solutions? There are. We

244
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:30,080
need more on-ramps to a middle-class life other than a traditional bachelor of arts and a lot of

245
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,680
societies are beginning to prioritize and invest in vocational programs to give people the

246
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:42,400
opportunity to have a middle-class life even if they're not able to get to college. So a prediction

247
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:49,840
here, will 2021 be the best or the worst year in decades? I don't think the answer has been written.

248
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,560
I think it's kind of up to us. You could see us coming out of this disaster stronger than ever.

249
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,680
The fires in London spawned an incredible era of architecture. The end of World War II

250
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:04,880
led us to make massive investments in Japan and Germany and turn them into tremendous allies

251
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:11,040
such that it really largely kept the peace for the next 70 years. There are certain plants,

252
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:18,160
pyrophilic plants that only germinate after a fire. At the same time this does appear to be

253
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:23,280
bringing out some of the worst attributes in our tribal nature as a species. We politicize everything

254
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:28,880
from masks and vaccines and we seem to have a lack of empathy around what's going on and we seem to be

255
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:36,160
ignoring science at the cost of tremendous human suffering. So the economy has largely bounced back

256
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:42,560
because of massive intervention and stimulus. We are seeing incredible GDP growth again. Even in Brazil

257
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:48,240
it's estimated that we're going to see real significant GDP growth. We're also unfortunately

258
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,920
seeing some of the same acceleration of current trends around income inequality. In the U.S. just

259
00:24:53,920 --> 00:25:00,880
one percent of the population garnered 90 percent of the gains post-COVID. We also have two people

260
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,760
in the U.S. who are now wealthier than the bottom 40 percent and we see the same thing in Brazil

261
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:12,800
where just six people have more wealth than half the nation. We're also seeing incredible income

262
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:18,160
inequality within companies whereas the CEOs and top management have seen their salaries

263
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:24,000
go up 14-fold whereas the average worker hasn't really had a raise in about 30 years.

264
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:32,560
So wages have not caught up. We've seen incredible gains in productivity. There's always a tension

265
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:36,960
between capital and labor and over the last 30 years capital quite frankly has been kicking the

266
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:44,080
crap out of labor and that delta in that line between productivity and profits is trillions of

267
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,480
dollars in shareholder value. The majority of that has gone back to shareholders and the top

268
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:54,160
management. So if you think about a society loosely bucketed into three cohorts consumers,

269
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:01,680
shareholders, and workers consumers are king. We now have the processing power of the space shuttle

270
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:08,880
for free in our pockets. Shareholders have done well. The NASDAQ is up five-fold since 2008.

271
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:14,640
It's workers that have had the toughest time and that is they have not seen not really seen a wage

272
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:21,520
increase in over 30 years. There are some incredibly encouraging things around a decrease in the poverty

273
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,480
rate specifically in the U.S. because of massive stimulus. We've seen the number of children living

274
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:33,920
in poverty decline by 60 percent. The bottom quintile of households have seen their incomes

275
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:39,680
increase by 20 or 30 percent. We're seeing it was temporary though in Brazil while the poverty

276
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:46,240
rate declined dramatically during emergency aid. Now that some of that emergency aid has ended we're

277
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:52,400
again seeing poverty rates start to escalate again. Obviously vaccines have been incredibly

278
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,560
important and we're seeing certain nations do a better job of getting them out and others.

279
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:01,520
Unfortunately in the U.S. vaccines have been politicized and we've seen an incredible drop

280
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:08,560
off in the number of vaccines being administered in the U.S. and then the vaccine or excuse me the

281
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:15,520
pathogen took advantage of this had time to morph had time to find new hosts times time to evolve

282
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:20,960
to new variants and we now in the U.S. as we do in Brazil have a variant that is not only more

283
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,880
infectious but just as virulent and in my home state of Florida we now have more children in

284
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:33,120
pediatric ICU's than there are in many European countries. There's a narrative that always evolves

285
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,680
that gives us comfort and one of those narratives was that this was not going to impact children

286
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:41,840
and we're finding out in the U.S. that that's just not true. I have an 11 year old you're not allowed

287
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,640
to get people vaccinated under the age of 12 and one of the reasons we are not in Florida is I will

288
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:52,080
not take my 11 year old back to Florida who is unvaccinated because I believe our leadership has

289
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:57,920
done such a terrible job of creating misinformation around vaccines and because so many people have

290
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:03,680
decided not to get a vaccination. This flies in the face of everything we know about truth and

291
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:08,080
about science and the bottom line is you're less likely to contract and less likely to spread

292
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:15,920
COVID-19 with a vaccine and it's just incredibly discouraging. I'm a big fan of the Game of Thrones

293
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:20,240
series and it's as if we we finally found Dragonstone something that can kill White

294
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:26,640
Walkers but we decided not to use this Dragonstone. I think this presents a tremendous opportunity

295
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:32,560
for the United States and that is we have incredible supply chain and can produce tremendous

296
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:39,040
quantities of vaccine. If you think about World War II when tyranny reigned across Europe and

297
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:44,080
threatened everywhere and it was going to threaten Latin America if Hitler had taken control of Europe

298
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:49,600
he then probably would have landed in Latin America at some point. Our supply chain basically

299
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,000
saved the world and that was we were able to produce more armaments. I think the similar

300
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,960
opportunity is here and that is we have more opportunity to flood the world with vaccine

301
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:04,720
than any other nation and I'd like to think the same generosity we demonstrated towards Japan

302
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,000
and Germany we could demonstrate towards India and Brazil and that is to storm the shores of

303
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,680
India and Brazil with vaccine and to reach out and grab the hands of our brothers and sisters

304
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:20,720
and create new strong bonds and new allies that might stand the test of time over the next several

305
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:26,960
decades. I'm going to end with a question around what is the profound opportunity coming out of

306
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:33,280
the novel coronavirus. I don't think it's economic. There's a meaningful opportunity professionally

307
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:38,000
and that is most auto races aren't one on the track they're one in the pits and that is if you

308
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:44,000
can continue to run around the track while everyone else is in the pits you're going to

309
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,120
win the race. Right now if you work for a company that offers you the technology and that company is

310
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:54,480
financially doing well you are healthy you are emotionally fit and you are able to work at full

311
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:00,480
capacity I think you should be working all the time. Why? My colleague at NYU Stern one of the

312
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:07,040
brightest strategy professors in the world talks about the notion of variance and that is when

313
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:13,120
there's huge variance that's where you want to invest. So for example if everybody in your

314
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:18,240
industry has great branch networks that's not where you invest but if there's huge variance

315
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,440
in their ability to data mine that's where you want to invest. Right now there's huge variance

316
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,920
in corporate Brazil and corporate America and that is a lot of people are able to work at full

317
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:32,000
productivity but a lot of people are not for different reasons. That is when you want to

318
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,880
work really hard. I think there's an opportunity to lap the competition if you will right now if

319
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:42,960
your company is blessed with the resources and you are emotionally financially and professionally

320
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,600
fit if you will. I think this is a tremendous opportunity to make progress because a lot of the

321
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:54,240
competition is stuck in the pits if you will. That is a meaningful opportunity. However, however

322
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:59,920
the profound opportunity is for the repair and cementing of key relationships. I wrote a book

323
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:05,760
on happiness because I struggle with my own happiness. My blessings are here my happiness

324
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:10,880
is here and I wanted to bring this and more in line with this. So happiness is similar to any

325
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,560
sport. If you want to be great at soccer you have to practice and I think if you want to be great

326
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:22,080
at happiness you have to study the concept and practice it. The key to being happy across almost

327
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:27,680
every study every ethnicity and every geography is the number of deep and meaningful relationships

328
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,840
you have. At work do you feel respected and admired and do you respect and admire other people?

329
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,640
Amongst your friends you get a sense of joy and camaraderie and do you know they know that you

330
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,360
feel a sense of joy and camaraderie and also across your family do you feel an intense level

331
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,720
of love and support and just as importantly do you know they know that they are intensely loved and

332
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:53,440
supported by you. So the profound opportunity is during a crisis is the repair and cementing of

333
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:59,600
relationships and that is people remember how you behave during a crisis. We give medals and ribbons

334
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,560
to our young men and women in uniform based on their ability to show grace and courage and love

335
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:11,280
during a crisis. We are in a crisis. People remember how you behave in a crisis. So three

336
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:18,000
questions and I end every presentation I'm giving. I will present over 300,000 people this year and

337
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,560
I end every presentation with the same three questions. Question one is this an opportunity

338
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:30,480
to pivot to becoming a caregiver for someone older in your life? A parent, an uncle, someone who is

339
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:36,800
struggling mentally or physically with the novel coronavirus. It's easy for us to expect care from

340
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:43,360
our parents. Is this that moment to pivot to being their parent if you will too? Do you have the

341
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:49,040
relationship with your siblings that you want? If you had been one of the people that was forced to

342
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:55,120
say goodbye to your sibling who was in the emergency room over FaceTime is your relationship where you

343
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:00,400
want it to be? And then finally have you made the requisite investments in friendships to maintain

344
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:05,920
those friendships or have you let perceived slights or competitiveness or other bullshit get in the

345
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:11,600
way of those friendships? The key to our happiness is the number of deep and meaningful relationships

346
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,160
and the novel coronavirus presents us with a tremendous opportunity if you are blessed with

347
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:21,840
health, financial security, and grace to repair and cement those relationships. A meaningful

348
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:28,800
opportunity professionally, a profound opportunity for the repair and cementing of key relationships.

349
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:34,800
Let's summarize. We are experiencing decades and days. The novel coronavirus's enduring feature will

350
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:39,680
be seen as an accelerant more than a change agent whether it's the number of people living at home,

351
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:44,320
whether it's income inequality, whether it's telehealth, whether it's dispersion of financial

352
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:49,600
markets. All the existing trends are just accelerating. An interesting question to ask yourself

353
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:55,440
take every trend professionally and personally and take it out 10 years and ask yourself are

354
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,080
we here right now and if so how would you change your business strategy and how would you change

355
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:06,160
your own personal approach to your own relationships? Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google continue to

356
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:11,360
their march. I believe that they have overrun government and are a threat to our society and

357
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:17,120
they should be broken up. We have an emerging crisis among young men who are not attaching to

358
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:21,920
work, not attaching to school, and not attaching to relationships and I believe that we are on the

359
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:27,040
precipice of what could be the best or the worst year in the last several decades but I don't think

360
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:33,120
it's an organic decision. I think it's up to us and I think the profound opportunity is to demonstrate

361
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:38,560
grace, forgiveness, and generosity during a crisis and we are in a crisis. The profound opportunity

362
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:44,880
again is to invest in and repair and cement key relationships. My name is Scott Galloway. I teach

363
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,560
at NYU. I'll stop right there and I'll open it up for questions and answers.

364
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:57,680
Thank you Scott. That was amazing. Thanks for your presentation. This is Fernando here. If I may

365
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:04,640
start with the question, I'm an avid listener of your podcast, the Prof. G show. The few times that

366
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:09,920
I'm able to go to the gym I always listen to it and one of your earlier predictions regarding

367
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:17,120
the big tech firms was that they need to be broken up, right? They are too powerful and you talk about

368
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:23,280
that, that they need to be separated at some sorts or there needs to be more regulation

369
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:29,840
on those companies. We've seen China going through that route in recent weeks and months

370
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:35,520
so I just wanted to see what are your thoughts regarding what China is doing and what the US

371
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,560
can or will do in the future with regards to regulation of the big tech firms?

372
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,680
Thanks for the question. I've been thinking a lot about this. Americans are some of the most,

373
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,920
I think we are an exceptionally innovative, generous people. We're also, our comorbidity is

374
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:57,120
our arrogance and that is we believe that the American way is so far superior we don't even

375
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:01,920
like to learn from other nations and I think there's a lot to be learned from what is going

376
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,160
on in China right now. China over the last 30 years has brought three quarters of a billion

377
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:11,600
people out of poverty so I'm not a fan of China. You could argue they're engaged in kind of

378
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:18,240
genocide, autocracy, but there's just no getting around it. Bringing 750 million people out of

379
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:24,400
poverty is one of the greatest accomplishments in the history of mankind so to not learn from the

380
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:29,840
Chinese is to basically decide to put your head in the sand and what can we learn? The Chinese have

381
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:36,000
looked across the Pacific at the United States and said we are not going to subvert societal

382
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,400
interest economic interests and they decided to essentially take some of these iconic companies

383
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,840
that seem to be engaged in economic or government overrun and they have severely curtailed their

384
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:52,960
power and they're talking about breaking them up. They have taken online tutoring companies

385
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:58,080
that were helping the children of rich families get into the best colleges and they have said no

386
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:02,080
more of that. They are worried about income inequality. They are worried about companies

387
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:07,440
or families building dynasties. They have decided that they are going to force video game companies

388
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,920
to limit the amount of time the young people spend on video games and social networks.

389
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:18,000
So when you look at what they've done essentially they have looked at the U.S. and said that the U.S.

390
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,960
is heading down a dangerous path of too much corporate concentration, a lack of regard for

391
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:28,000
the mental well-being of young people, and the emergence of income inequality through dynastic

392
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,600
wealth through education that's only accessible to the children of rich people. I think that is very

393
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:40,720
interesting and I think we should not, I'm not suggesting we adopt their kind of hard-handed

394
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:45,680
tactics, but I think it's interesting to look at China which plays the long game

395
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:50,480
and has been more successful than any nation relatively speaking economically over the last

396
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:57,040
30 years and to understand or register what they see as being the biggest mistakes in the United

397
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:02,160
States. So I think there's a lot to learn there. I personally don't think that these companies,

398
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,440
I think they're going to wrap their knuckles but I don't think they're going to cut their fingers

399
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,440
off. I personally think that these internet companies are really good investments right now.

400
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:16,000
For example, Alibaba, which is the Amazon of Asia trades at a forward price earnings multiple of

401
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:22,880
about 17 versus Amazon trades at 60 despite the fact that Alibaba is growing faster than Amazon.

402
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,440
So basically when you buy Alibaba you're buying Amazon for a third of the price because there's

403
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:32,640
such a chill and there's such a concern that China is going to withdraw from the capital markets

404
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,760
and that any investment in these companies is going to be stranded. I don't think that's the

405
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:43,920
case. I think the Chinese are effectively sent a very strong signal of these companies but they're

406
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:50,560
not going to shut them down. So I think China offers an opportunity for us to learn by seeing

407
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:57,280
how they see the U.S. I do believe the U.S. is going to break up big tech. We have a tendency

408
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,480
to think that it's bad for capitalism. If you look at most breakups the shareholders win. So for

409
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:08,480
example, PayPal used to be part of eBay. It's now worth dramatically more than eBay. Spends typically

410
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,120
work. When AT&T, our biggest telco, was broken up in the 80s here in the U.S. each of the seven

411
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:18,640
companies the baby bells that was broken up into ended up being worth more than the original AT&T

412
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:23,600
with just 10 years. So I don't think we break up these companies necessarily because they're bad

413
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:29,280
people or some sort of punishment but because breaking them up is a key component of oxygenating

414
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,720
the economy. So I think the breakup is coming and I think it'll be good for the stock market,

415
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:41,600
good for investors, good for job growth, good for the planet. Thank you so much. Who wants to go next?

416
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:48,720
Okay sure. So thank you for your brilliant presentation professor. I guess I've also

417
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:55,600
become a fan of your podcast and I've heard on a couple of different occasions you mention a very

418
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:02,080
interesting a bit polemic view I would say for some especially at these times in terms of what

419
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:08,480
young people should focus when they think about what to do with their lives in career-wise I would

420
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:15,600
say and I say I quote here something that I heard in your podcast, find your talent, don't find your

421
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:22,400
passion. So I personally think this is an amazing view. I've been a fan of doing that. I've been

422
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:28,240
trying to do that for my whole life but most people say I'm a bit crazy so I was very happy

423
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,960
to hear someone as brilliant as you say something like that. I don't know could you could you say a

424
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:40,400
bit further and share your views on this? Thanks for being kind. So at the business school we're

425
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,720
very fortunate we get guest speakers almost every day and generally there's two types of speakers.

426
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,360
Someone who is very impressive and very accomplished or a billionaire. In the U.S. we've

427
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:54,480
decided anyone that reaches a billion dollars in wealth has insight into life and they always end

428
00:40:54,480 --> 00:41:00,080
their speech with what I think is just terrible advice and they say follow your passion and it's

429
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:04,240
somewhat ironic because typically the person telling you to follow your passion made their

430
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:10,240
billions in iron ore smelting or health care maintenance. Typically I think as a young person

431
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:16,640
you should be wary that anyone who tells you to follow your passion is already rich and I wanted

432
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:21,200
to be an athlete, a professional athlete growing up and I learned very quickly that that was not

433
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:26,160
where my talent lied and so I tried to find something I was good at and I think your job

434
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:32,000
as a young person is to find something you're good at and then to invest the requisite grit,

435
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:38,960
thousands of hours enduring hardship, enduring failure, enduring frustration. That's called work

436
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,440
and then become great at it and when you become great at something the accoutrements of being

437
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:51,120
great at it money, economic security, prestige, camaraderie, self-worth, all of those things will

438
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:56,960
make you passionate about whatever it is. Nobody grows up passionate about tax law

439
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:02,720
but the best tax lawyers in the world fly private and have a much broader selection set of mates

440
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:08,480
than they deserve which makes them passionate about tax law. So do your passions on weekends,

441
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:15,040
be a DJ, play soccer on weekends but find something that you could be the best in the world at.

442
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:24,560
That's your job. That's your job. Arthur? Hi Scott. Going back to your sector which is education,

443
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:31,680
you showed the chart between profits and wages, right? Let's face it, the majority of the world

444
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:38,160
is going to be workers, right? I mean does it mean that we have had a massive failure of educational

445
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:44,000
systems that are not able to keep up with technology and can we change that going forward?

446
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:51,040
I do think there's been a failure amongst myself and my cohorts and that is we no longer see

447
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:59,360
ourselves as, Arthur, as public servants. We see ourselves as luxury brands and that is,

448
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:07,200
so when I went to UCLA the admittance rate was 70% meaning if 100 people applied 70 got in and I had

449
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:12,640
to apply twice to get in and the cost was approximately a thousand dollars a year. This

450
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:20,320
year the admittance rate will be 9% and the cost is $35,000 a year which means that I wouldn't be

451
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:25,360
here. I'm not a humble person. I think I'm exceptionally talented but the reason I'm here

452
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:29,840
speaking to you from Nantucket and getting to do wonderful things with my life and provide economic

453
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:37,280
security for my family is because back in the 80s we used to let in unremarkable kids into college

454
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:43,120
and they let in the sons of single immigrant mothers who lived and died as secretary which

455
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:48,880
was my mother. We never had a household income more than $35,000 a year. The U.S. education

456
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,360
system and to a certain extent the global education system used to be about finding good people and

457
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:59,360
giving them great opportunities. In the U.S. we've now become Hermes and that is we think our job

458
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,480
is not to find good kids and give them great opportunities but our job is to find the top 1%

459
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:12,080
and turn them into billionaires. That's not the purpose of an economy. The key to any economy

460
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:17,200
is to give unremarkable people remarkable opportunities so I think we need to fall

461
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:22,640
back in love with the unremarkables. Harvard got 55,000 applications this year and they let in

462
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:29,040
1,400 students. This despite the fact they sit on an endowment that's the GDP of El Salvador.

463
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:33,600
They could let in 14,000 people not sacrifice any quality and they'd have the resources so the

464
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:38,880
question is well why wouldn't they? And a lot of us brag I don't know if you've done this a lot of

465
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:44,720
us brag about we say I would never get into the college I went into I went to I would never be

466
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,800
admitted. Well don't brag about that because that means your daughter's not getting in.

467
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:54,160
So we in public education need to fall back in love with the unremarkables and stop thinking

468
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,720
of ourselves as Chanel and Hermes and go back to a world where we are public servants.

469
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:04,560
The children of rich people they're the ones that don't need college. They have a great education

470
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,920
up until that point. They have connections. They have money. They have a safety net. They have access

471
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:13,040
to capital. It's the people we're not letting in that need college the most so we need to fall back

472
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:19,840
in love with unremarkables. We need to go back to a viewpoint that education is not a luxury brand

473
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:26,480
that we're public servants and we need to massively massively increase enrollment rates and decrease

474
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:31,840
costs through a mix of small and big tech and me and my cohorts need to be recognized that we are

475
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:37,440
not luxury brands we are public servants we have totally lost the script. Higher education in the

476
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:43,040
U.S. has become the enforcer of the caste system. It used to be an incredible upward lubricant and

477
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:50,800
we need to return to those roots. Well unfortunately our timing is coming to an end so on the name of

478
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:55,840
XP I'd like to thank you very much Scott for being here with us for your fantastic presentation for

479
00:45:55,840 --> 00:46:02,560
everything you do. Hopefully we can get you here on the ground next year when this event goes back

480
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:09,680
to being live hopefully knock on wood but thank you so much. Thank you best best of wishes greetings

481
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,240
everybody.

482
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:31,280
Thank you Raquel and for everyone who followed us in this conversation and don't miss the next

483
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,240
