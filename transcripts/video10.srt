1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
This week's number, 34 million. That's how many times listeners downloaded a PropG episode in 2023.

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,080
Wow. Thanks so much. We are humbled. No, we're not. We fucking rock the house.

3
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,240
Welcome to PropG Markets. Ed, what are we discussing today?

4
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,880
We're going to go through your 2024 predictions, Scott, and we're also going to share some questions

5
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,440
and comments that we received from the live stream audience. And by the way, one of the most frequent

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,800
comments that we saw on the live stream were requests for you to slow down. So that's what we're

7
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,160
going to try to accomplish today. We're going to do a deeper breakdown of your predictions. Sound good?

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,240
Yeah, sounds great. Except for the slow down part.

9
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,160
Let's start with your first prediction, which is housing sales boom. What do you mean by that?

10
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:05,200
Sales will accelerate. Look, there's pan-up-to-man, death, disease, divorce, household formation.

11
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,240
They just, people want to procreate. They want to buy a home. Interest rates have come down about

12
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,240
a hundred BIPs in the last 60 or 90 days. And I think they'll come down further. And in addition,

13
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,000
you're just going to see certain mortgages roll. So the incentive to stick around, you can either

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,160
refinance your house at a much higher interest rate or you can go buy a new one. But it just

15
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:32,080
strikes me that it won't return to pre-pandemic levels, but it's going to be substantially up.

16
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,720
I also think in me, I did some interesting research here. There's going to be

17
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,760
alternative, all sorts of alternative housing. We see all of these VCs, and I think this is a good

18
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:46,320
thing, incorporating whole cities. They're literally just going and buying tens of thousands of acres,

19
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:53,040
incorporating it as a city to avoid all nimbious restrictive bullshit zoning requirements that

20
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,160
basically just entrench and transfer wealth from people looking for a home to the incumbents that

21
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:03,440
already own a home. So I just don't think this is sustainable. And I think we're going to see a lot

22
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:08,080
of pent up demand come into the market. And I think you're going to see a housing boom in 2024 or a

23
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,040
housing purchase boom, I should say. A question from Philip. What about young people who can work

24
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,760
remotely? Do you think they all move to so-called second and third tier cities where life is less

25
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,920
expensive? It's a complicated question. It depends where. So for example, a lot of people who moved

26
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,520
to Austin are now moving to other cities in Texas because they've been priced out of Austin.

27
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:31,840
Anyone who could engage in the remote work arbitrage has kind of done so. And I actually

28
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,720
believe you're going to see a little bit of an uptick, a little bit of a return to the office.

29
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,520
We've been thinking about that at ProfG here. I believe that 2024, we need to have more people,

30
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,640
I don't want to say in the office, but we need to have a more formal means of getting more people

31
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,440
together more regularly. I don't know, I sound like David Solomon or one of these boomer

32
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,360
investment banking guys, but I do think you lose something. I think you're going to see

33
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,440
a slight uptick in occupancy rates back in offices. The market for cities is like the

34
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:09,600
market for products. San Francisco prices itself out of the market and is unable to

35
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,320
address the homeless problem. So it's both bad and expensive, which means people leave and you see

36
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,720
basically the commercial real estate market has collapsed there. And even the rental and housing

37
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,760
market for the first time is starting to decline. So I think you're going to see there's certain

38
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,880
lifestyle arbitrage cities. You'll see more of those in Texas and Florida because of the lower

39
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:35,840
tax rates. I think Mexico City and Madrid still offer the best lifestyle arbitrage in North America

40
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:43,440
and Europe. But yeah, that's not anything unusual, but people who still have real money and real

41
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,920
ambition and sometimes it's more important to have the latter than the former are going to do

42
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,960
their best to get to a super city. And one of my big pieces of advice to young people is before

43
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,520
you collect dogs and kids, get to a super city because that's the density of opportunity, the

44
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,840
crush of humanity and capital, the results in that opportunity. You have two stock picks

45
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,640
that you call the streaming laggards, AKA Disney and Warner Brothers Discovery.

46
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,760
Why are they your stock picks for 2024? I think Disney is going to get put in play. If it doesn't,

47
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:20,960
it stocks at a 10-year low. It's got iconic, you know, inimitable assets and it has a park

48
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:25,200
business that's doing 10 billion in EBITDA that really is singular. The park business in my view,

49
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:31,360
now granted you would argue that the figures of the IP is the real moat here, but they leverage

50
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:38,160
their IP with rides at Disney and also just the moat of building several hundred thousand acre park.

51
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,960
That takes decades. Netflix can't do that or at least they can't do that within 10 or 20 years.

52
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:49,360
And other than MGM Universal or Universal Orlando, nothing even comes close. And so these

53
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,400
are iconic assets. It's underperformed. So the stock either has to go up or it's put in play or

54
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:01,280
it starts getting hostile bids from potential acquirers. So I think that stock goes up this year.

55
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,640
And then I think Warner Brothers Discovery has basically been a debt story and that is it has

56
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,000
such a huge amount of debt and David Zaslov to his credit has paid down that debt pretty

57
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,560
aggressively. And when he pays it down, then the enterprise value, if it stays the same,

58
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,920
that means the equity value should go up because the enterprise value of the company

59
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,480
is what people think is the value of the company minus the debt plus the cash. So as the debt gets

60
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,120
reduced, the value should go up. I also think that there's a consolidation in the streaming market

61
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,880
that will give Max or better known as HBO more pricing power. There's going to be fewer players.

62
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,720
They're consolidating. Netflix has already raised prices 15 to 30 percent, which will create cloud

63
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,760
cover for HBO to raise prices. And they're all cutting costs. They're all reducing their

64
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:54,080
programming lineups dramatically. And the Rider Strike was nothing but a gift to them. They gave

65
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,560
them the opportunity to take a pause and recalibrate their costs. So I like both Warner

66
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,240
Brothers Discovery and Disney as kind of safe plays. I think their downside is somewhat limited

67
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,240
and I think they offer kind of, I don't know, 30 to 60 percent upside.

68
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,600
You also have a side prediction that an activist investor is going to come and

69
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,000
approach Warner Brothers. Why do you think that?

70
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,960
Well, there's a scene in Wall Street where Charlie Sheen keeps saying,

71
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,920
Why do you need to wreck this company? Because it's wreckable, all right?

72
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,480
And Warner Brothers Discovery is breakable in the sense that it has a single class of shares.

73
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:33,120
What John Stanky at AT&T demanded was that if he was going to take stock in exchange for selling

74
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:40,480
Time Warner to Discovery, that he wanted to be a single class of stock such that the likelihood

75
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:46,720
that a takeover might happen is always there. And therefore, there's a takeover premium in the stock.

76
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,640
So a lot of stocks that have dual class shareholder structures technically traded at discount

77
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,120
because even if the stock gets really cheap, for example, a Peloton or something like that,

78
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,840
or a New York Times, nobody can come in and make a bid like they did in Macy's that sends the stock

79
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:05,280
skyrocketing because the Solzbergers own 2 percent of the shares, but they control the company.

80
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,760
So there is no takeover premium or takeover possibility premium in the New York Times stock.

81
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:15,120
And Stanky said, I don't give a shit about your headaches as the CEO, fending off activists.

82
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,560
I want to maximize the value of my shares in the company, so I want it to be a single class of

83
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,760
stock. So long-winded way of saying Warner Brothers Discovery is breakable. And that is somebody

84
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:28,720
could come in and say, I want to take the company. I want to split it up. I want to sell these assets

85
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:35,120
or I want to swallow the whole thing and make it part of whatever, make it part of my telco again,

86
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:41,200
or who knows. Somebody is going to pop up an activist or an acquirer if this company continues

87
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:46,480
to pay down its debt, which I think it will, even if it's not at the same rate, and shows signs of

88
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,080
life and bouncing off the bottom. I also think CNN, which gets a disproportionate amount of

89
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,040
attention because it's the most kind of arguably the most iconic asset, maybe the exception of

90
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,400
HBO, is going to have a great year because everybody's going to be watching

91
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:05,520
whether or not Trump gets sentenced or whatever dipshit thing Elon says. I think that CNN during

92
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,720
an election year is going to print money. Are you personally buying these stocks?

93
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:15,600
No, I don't buy and sell that many stocks. I'm kind of saving my dry powder for some private

94
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:22,560
investment opportunities. I'm also thinking about selling some stocks. My biggest holdings

95
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,000
are Apple, Amazon, and Airbnb. I've experienced really solid, even extraordinary gains in those,

96
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,440
and I'm thinking of getting out of them and diversifying out of tech. I have a lot of tech,

97
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,920
public tech stocks, into credit. It strikes me that for the first time in a long time,

98
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,440
you're being paid to be in credit. I have some friends in the distressed credit business,

99
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,440
and you can get kind of unlevered 12 to 15% returns. I'm in a position in my life where I

100
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,240
want to de-risk, and I think one way of doing that, I'm very invested in tech through a lot

101
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,520
of my private investments. I'm thinking of transitioning out of many of my tech holdings

102
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,320
into credit instruments. Let's move on to the next prediction.

103
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,360
TikTok comes for Netflix and Spotify. I think the implication is pretty clear there, but

104
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,920
how do you see TikTok's ascent playing out in the traditional media ecosystem?

105
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,040
TikTok just continues to garner more and more mindshare, more and more people's time. I don't

106
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:21,920
know if you remember those charts that showed that newspapers were getting 15% of all ad dollars

107
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,360
despite the fact they were only getting 6% of people's time. Eventually, money matches time

108
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:34,720
spent or eyeballs. Every year, every day, TikTok is garnering more and more time of the most valuable

109
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,440
consumer in the world, and that is a young male who buys stupid high-margin products.

110
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:46,000
The data I saw that was really compelling was that Netflix consumption has actually

111
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,400
leveled out for not only kids but also for adults while YouTube and TikTok continue to go up.

112
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:59,120
In addition, I think that TikTok offers something so singular and so powerful that we miss it,

113
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:05,360
and that is it's one channel. There's no choice. It uses the signal liquidity of all the different

114
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,800
actions you provide to the algorithm, the AI-driven algorithm of what you're enjoying or not enjoying,

115
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:17,120
and it begins to calibrate in on content that is just extraordinary. Why do you need 400 channels?

116
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,280
You don't. You only need one as long as it's the right channel and it knows exactly what you want.

117
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:27,280
Consumers spend something like 50 minutes a week deciding what to watch on Netflix.

118
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:33,040
How much would someone have to pay you to say, all right, this week you're not taking a vacation,

119
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,200
you're sitting in your living room and you're deciding what you're going to watch for the

120
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,760
rest of the year on Netflix. We wake up Monday at 9 a.m. and until 5 p.m., you do nothing but decide

121
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,360
and plan out what you're going to watch on Netflix for the rest of the year. Then Tuesday, you do

122
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:53,440
the same thing, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. That is the tax the choice places on you. Even though

123
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,240
Netflix has an outstanding recommendation engine, it's dwarfed by the recommendation

124
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:06,080
that is one channel called TikTok. Side question from Leith. I hope I pronounced that correctly.

125
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,880
Apologies if I didn't. What do you think of Netflix moving into sports? It strikes me that

126
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:17,920
I don't want to say it doesn't make sense, but the reason why sports captures so much revenue

127
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:24,400
and such extraordinary rights fees is because it's one of the few media vehicles that people

128
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,560
still want to watch live, meaning it's some of the few media vehicles that people will

129
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:34,960
endure advertising. It's the same reason Netflix isn't in news, and that is news and sports have

130
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:40,000
a perishability about them. Netflix is in the business of non-perishable content. I'm watching

131
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,400
squid games. I think that's two or three years old, but it doesn't matter and they have it all

132
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,960
and it's all queued up and ready to go and I can binge watch it. Whereas when you watch CNN,

133
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,240
you don't want to watch day old CNN and that's part of the reason it's powerful because you're

134
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,520
willing to watch it live. You want to hear a free take. And so you're willing to watch

135
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,880
a commercial telling you have opioid induced constipation or restless legs.

136
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,360
We'll be right back.

137
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,000
We're back with ProfG Markets. So I'm just going to move us to the next one, which is Peak AI.

138
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:19,120
You say we've reached peak AI. And by the way, last year you said that AI would be tech of the

139
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,160
year, which count in that prediction is correct. You also said Open AI's valuation is going to

140
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,840
come down and that the quote empires will strike back. What did you mean by that?

141
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:34,320
I don't think we've hit peak AI in terms of its impact on business and the economy. I think we've

142
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,800
hit peak Open AI valuation. I don't think that valuation won't maintain its velocity. I think

143
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:47,120
$90 billion and the valuation that the whole Magnificent Seven that's been AI driven has kind

144
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,760
of been fully incorporated. I think Open AI is an amazing company, but I think at $90 billion,

145
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,200
a lot of that kind of amazingness, if you will, has been factored into that price.

146
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:03,920
Now it might in fact do really well in 2025, but I feel like, I don't want to say it's gotten

147
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:09,360
ahead of itself, but it is definitely, that is a forward looking valuation. There's a lot of

148
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,080
promise built into that valuation that I think it'll recognize. I just don't think the performance

149
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:20,480
can live up to the promise in 2024. So I think that a lot of those stocks, Nvidia, Microsoft,

150
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:28,560
Open AI that have largely been run up based on kind of the AI hype, I think the hype, if you will,

151
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,320
is going to continue, but I don't think they're going to maintain those sort of gains in 2024.

152
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,400
Who's the empire striking back then?

153
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,040
I think it's Alphabet and that's my big tech stock pick. I think Gemini and its access to

154
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:46,800
proprietary data, including your Gmail account, YouTube, your calendar, I think it's going to

155
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,640
give them a leg up and have all sorts of really interesting applications that'll get people

156
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:57,840
excited again about Alphabet. Also on a relative valuation basis, it looks reasonable compared to

157
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:03,120
the other guys. Is there anything else beyond AI that makes you optimistic and bullish on Alphabet?

158
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,080
I think one thing you mentioned may have been YouTube.

159
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:11,280
Yeah, YouTube is effectively the fastest growing media platform outside of TikTok. And that is

160
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,360
YouTube and TikTok are taking share basically from everybody else. And YouTube is now bigger

161
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,240
than any cable channel. It's growing double digits. It attracts that kind of elusive great

162
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,600
white rhino and that is young men. And they're getting into TV and the user reviews are great

163
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,720
on it. It just strikes me that YouTube is sort of, you know, the big engine that could and

164
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,760
continues to take share from the cable guys. Its ad model is outstanding. The ads that to me there

165
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:43,920
aren't quite as offensive because of that whole five second, you can skip ads. I think that Alphabet

166
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:49,520
still has the largest toll booth in the world in the form of search, has growth vehicles in terms

167
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:57,120
of YouTube. And I think that it's about to recognize that AI inspired bump party that they were sort of

168
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:03,520
left out of. Even though the stock's up, I think about 33 or 35% this year. So it hasn't under

169
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:07,520
performed the market. It's overperformed, but I don't think it's had the same kind of champagne

170
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,920
and cocaine up draft that everyone else has had. And I think it's going to register that in 2024.

171
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:18,160
Okay, next one, tech of the year, GLP ones, i.e. weight loss drugs. Take us through that.

172
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:24,160
I think this is going to have all sorts of impact in the diabetes or the obesity economy is $1.7

173
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:32,800
trillion. It's, I mean, what is that? That's like 8% of the economy. And if you look at McDonald's,

174
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:40,000
PepsiCo, General Foods, if you look at Coca-Cola, they're literally obesity indices. As obesity has

175
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,400
gone from 30 to 40%, as morbid obesity has gone from five to 10% in the last 10 years,

176
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:53,520
these companies stocks are up seven, 10, 20 fold. And when you see a decline in obesity and morbid

177
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:58,720
obesity, I think you're going to see the same type of deceleration in these stock prices. I don't

178
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,000
think we've even scratched the surface in terms of companies that are, you know, kidney dialysis

179
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,480
companies, medical equipment manufacturers, you know, companies that produce all those motorized

180
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:16,640
vehicles for people who have become too obese to get from Tomorrowland to Fantasyland to Disneyland.

181
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,040
I think it's just going to be enormous and there's going to be all sorts of

182
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:25,920
benefits and weirdness and we're going to see from these drugs. Tech of the year, GLP-1 drugs.

183
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:31,920
Comment from Andres, quote, I don't buy this prediction. Scott isn't considering access to

184
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:37,600
GLP-1s. That's a great point. So bottom line is it's not getting to the obese. It's getting to

185
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,600
ladies of lunch who want to lose that last 10 or 15 pounds. Having said that,

186
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:48,560
and that's who I know is on GLP-1 is basically rich housewives. That's who, and fat dudes are

187
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,400
my friends who are wealthy and just very overweight. Guys who are very overweight

188
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,000
and women who are modestly overweight that have money. That's who I see using it.

189
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,800
Maybe that's just the people I hang out with. But anyways, I was going to say,

190
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:05,280
I think those are the only people you know. Probably true. But I do think there is so much

191
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:10,640
money in R&D. I do think the market's going to do its job here and there will be all sorts of

192
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:17,600
innovation and specifically lower price drugs that do start to permeate or melt into the

193
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,760
region's neighborhoods and demographics that could most benefit from this. I also think the

194
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,240
government's going to get involved and start probably saying this qualifies for Medicare,

195
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,840
Medicaid, or what have you. So it'll take a while. It's definitely not getting to the right people

196
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,160
now, but I think it will eventually. Next prediction, India is the new China.

197
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,880
What does that mean? This year, India will bring more people into the middle class than China.

198
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,360
It's now the most populous nation in the world and it doesn't have the same demographic

199
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:54,000
problems that China has. In addition, it's just growing off of a smaller base. All the things we

200
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,680
said about India 30 years ago still hold true. It's a democracy, more English speakers than any other

201
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:06,240
nation in the world, I think, more PhDs, and it's kind of a swing vote in terms of where it is

202
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:13,600
geographically. I think India is, I think just as people were looking to China for incredible

203
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:20,080
manufacturing might and to invest there because of an emerging middle class, I think that the same

204
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,880
excitement and the same dynamics are forming in India. And I think America is going to say,

205
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:30,160
and a lot of Western nations are going to say, it's not probably a bad idea to diversify away

206
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,040
from China and make some big bets in India. So I think all the moons are lining up for India.

207
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:41,120
Are you going to try to expose yourself to any Indian stocks and take part in that ascent?

208
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,800
I'm going to resist the answer to the question, are you going to try and expose yourself?

209
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:53,360
That's just too easy. That's just too easy. Anyways, am I going to try and expose myself

210
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,480
to India? I haven't so far. What I do want to do, I want to go to India. I have a lot of

211
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:04,080
my closest friends are, see, I'm not a racist. Some of my closest friends are Indian.

212
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,840
Yeah, I'm being very honest. My closest friends at Stern are Indian and I've always wanted to go

213
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,720
there. I'm interested in the culture. I've always been a little bit intimidated by it,

214
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:20,640
but it's definitely the one country, the biggest, most important nation that I haven't been to. So

215
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,360
I don't know if I'm going to invest, but I'm definitely going to make a couple trips down

216
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,000
there in 2024 and try to get a feel for what's going on. Next prediction is a geopolitical

217
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:36,080
prediction. Saudi Arabia and Israel normalize relations and then also US and China relations

218
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,240
thaw. Let's start with Saudi Arabia. What do you think is going to happen there?

219
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,640
I think the kingdom is making reforms at a faster pace than any nation in the world.

220
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,840
Granted, that's from a bad place, but every three to six months, MBS rolls out new reforms,

221
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,160
whether it's, and this sounds incredibly primitive, but women being able to travel

222
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,440
without the permission of their male guardian or women being able to drive or alcohol, whatever it

223
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,640
is, they are reforming faster than any nation in the world. And the other kind of anecdotal

224
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,080
observation I would make was when I was in Mykonos, I noticed that at all the clubs,

225
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,320
all the tables were filled by kids from the Gulf. I think they are pivoting towards capitalism.

226
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:18,720
And the other large economy in the Mideast is Israel. They need tech. Israel needs capital.

227
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:25,120
It seems to me like a marriage made in heaven. And I think that if you will, MBS is, you know,

228
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,320
trying to pull off the ultimate pivot away from fossil fuels, but also a pivot away from extremism

229
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:36,400
and fundamentalism to capitalism. And it strikes me then these talks and this kind of thawing or

230
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,400
whatever you want to call it as well underway, the conflict in the Middle East has put that off. It

231
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,840
may not happen next year, but I think it'll definitely happen in 2025. And also if you look

232
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:49,760
at the Kingdom Ed, they've been remarkably quiet. They haven't been shitposting Israel or

233
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:56,560
putting out a lot of statements of outrage or indignance about, you know, the bombing in Gaza.

234
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,880
It just says to me that they're like, okay, they set us back. We got to wait.

235
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:06,400
But and that'll be the ultimate iron dome for Israel. So I'm actually quite excited about the

236
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,840
prospect of the Kingdom and Israel normalizing relations. I think it makes sense for both of

237
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,080
them. And I think it'll be good for peace in the Middle East and good for the world. And then with

238
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,400
respect to China and the US, sorry, before we move on to China, I just want to interject with a

239
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:28,080
comment from Jeffrey says, quote, I wish Scott was as critical of Saudi Arabia as he is of Elon Musk.

240
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,120
What's your response to that? Well, I wish I had a bigger deck and a lot more money.

241
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:43,920
Okay. I wish for a lot of things, Ed. I think I call it as I see it in the Kingdom. I think

242
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:51,120
the Kingdom, I think the Kingdom, if the West wanted to write a script for how it wanted the

243
00:21:51,120 --> 00:22:00,080
Kingdom to behave, like a pivot to capitalism, reforms, buying a shit ton of products, you know,

244
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:08,640
it just strikes me that the Kingdom is kind of kind of coming to us. And so, I mean, keep in mind,

245
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,440
the Kingdom used to spend all of its money on funding a cold war with Iran and a hot war in

246
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,560
Yemen. And instead now it's spending its money on trying to pivot away from fossil fuels to education,

247
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:24,320
manufacturing, investing in tech companies. We have access to incredibly cheap capital in the US.

248
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:31,200
And with respect to Elon, look, I want to acknowledge that he is a remarkable

249
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,200
innovator. I think he's great at what he does. And I also think it's a Jew-baiting absentee father.

250
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,600
And I just call it as I see it. And I'd like to think I call it as I see it

251
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,480
in the Kingdom. But from an American interest standpoint, I think the Kingdom's move and

252
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,680
MBS as a reformer is arguably one of the best things to happen for the West. If the world is

253
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:57,920
becoming bipolar, that is China and Russia versus the US and Europe, the two key swing votes just

254
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:02,560
as less than 100,000 suburban moms are going to decide who the next president is. Do you realize

255
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:08,880
a bunch of moms in the suburbs of Akron, Ohio are going to decide the war in Ukraine? Basically,

256
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,600
they're going to decide who wins because whoever wins president, if Biden wins president, Ukraine

257
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,640
probably wins the war or at least it's at a extended stalemate. If Trump is reelected,

258
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:25,360
Putin is one. And the soccer mom or the suburban mom in Akron, Ohio is India and the Kingdom to a

259
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:31,600
lesser extent Indonesia and Turkey. But effectively, for our own self-interest, just being very

260
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:38,080
selfish about American interests, I think that we want to embrace India and the Kingdom. And with

261
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,240
respect to Elon, I just think he couldn't be a shittier role model for young men.

262
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:50,800
I think what Jeffrey would probably respond to your comment there is your point is the soccer

263
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:55,520
moms decide, in this case Saudi Arabia is the soccer mom and so we got to play ball with them.

264
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:00,560
But if a soccer mom chopped up a US journalist with a bone saw,

265
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,440
do we still kowtow to the soccer mom because they're influential and because

266
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,320
they're going to decide the fate of the country? And I think that this is where the criticism

267
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:21,680
lands is where is your line here in terms of yes, we need to accomplish our own geopolitical goals

268
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:29,760
and it's true that being friends with the rich guy is a good thing. But do we need to sacrifice

269
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:36,560
something or do we decide that Saudi Arabia, their human rights violations haven't been bad enough

270
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,320
to cut ties? So let's be clear, they murdered Jamal Khashoggi, they murdered a US resident who

271
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:47,360
was a journalist for the Washington Post. The question is, all right, so do we not do business

272
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,320
with them any longer? Is that it? Because if that's the bar, we're not going to be doing business with

273
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:57,680
the majority of nations around the world for a long time. And to be clear, your bar with Elon Musk,

274
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,120
you don't want to do business with him, you don't want to be on Twitter. I mean,

275
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,880
I mean, Elon has crossed some line for you, which is, I don't think he's ever killed anyone

276
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,680
with a bone saw. The analogy really doesn't hold there. I think America should continue to do

277
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,680
business with Elon Musk. I think they should continue to buy his products. I think they

278
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:21,680
should continue to produce great graduates for his companies. I think they should continue to

279
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:27,920
host him and provide him with the same rights as any other citizen. I don't have to buy his car

280
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:34,240
or be on his platform as a consumer. It's pretty simple. And when you're talking about nation

281
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:40,720
states and geopolitics, yeah, I think it's easy to be a purist. So the question is,

282
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:46,160
do we not do business with the kingdom moving forward because they murdered a US resident

283
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:51,760
journalist? And if some people decide that's it, that's their red line, I get it, more power to

284
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:57,760
you. I think the long-term interests of the United States, I mean, for God sakes, we went into Iraq,

285
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:04,880
under false pretense and killed 420,000 people. But because it's 420,000 people and we don't know

286
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:12,080
any of their names, it's like what is it Stalin said, one death is a tragedy, hundreds of thousands

287
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:17,440
of deaths are a statistic. So I am very focused on the wellbeing and the prosperity of the US.

288
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:25,360
And I think that that prosperity is best served by one, continuing to do business with Elon Musk

289
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,760
and creating an environment where geniuses like him, and he is a genius, continue to innovate

290
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,080
and that he has the opportunity to become the wealthiest man in the world and party in St.

291
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:39,040
Barts and then fly around on a 650 and cosplay being a statesman and then come back and go to

292
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:45,120
Burning Man and do Ketamine, more power to him. I think we also continue to do business with India

293
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:52,560
and the kingdom because I want Americans to have more access to universities, a bigger Navy,

294
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:57,840
more access to capital to grow their companies and more tax revenues for child tax credit,

295
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,800
for our parks. I want America to win. And the way we win is by having a certain amount of rail

296
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:08,160
politic and that is recognizing it's a big, bad fucking world out there and we have to make hard

297
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,720
decisions. And I don't even think this one is a hard one. We absolutely bear hug India and the kingdom.

298
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,240
We'll be right back.

299
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:28,720
We're back with ProfG Markets. Next prediction, Musk loses control of Twitter or he sells it.

300
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:35,440
Yeah, I just think at some point this shit show that is Twitter jumps the shark and starts

301
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,640
infecting his other assets and he's going to make so much money off of SpaceX, which is an amazing

302
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:46,960
product, specifically Starlink and also Tesla was the golden goose. His new golden goose is going to

303
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:53,360
be Starlink. And at some point when he continues to do these crazy things like platform Alex Jones,

304
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:58,880
it's just going to come back to haunt him. I mean, he's basically just recently insulted,

305
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,720
basically said, fuck you to Bob Iger. I don't see how that helps him. Literally said it.

306
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,920
If somebody's going to try to blackmail me with advertising, blackmail me with money,

307
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,920
go fuck yourself.

308
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,640
Blackmail me with money? Go fuck yourself.

309
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:25,200
But go fuck yourself. Is that clear? I hope it is. Hey, Bob.

310
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,920
I don't see how an advertising based platform that has registered the greatest decline in

311
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:36,080
revenues of any company over a billion dollars has creditors he owes 13 billion to who don't

312
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,400
know when to sell this thing because he keeps doing these insane things that take the revenue

313
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,880
of the company down, thereby creating risk he's not going to be able to make those interest

314
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,760
payments. He's literally about to cost blow the quarter for Morgan Stanley, Barclays,

315
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,960
and I forget who the third one is, B of A, when they have to recognize these losses because the

316
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,440
manchild can't keep his fucking mouth shut and nobody wants to advertise on his platform.

317
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:07,120
In addition, I wonder when Apple kicks him out of the app store for violations of their terms of

318
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:13,520
service because at some point the hate speech is so out of control on the platform that they say,

319
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,280
okay, you're no longer in the app store. And then what happens to the company?

320
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:21,840
So that's what they did with Infowars. Info Alex Jones's app got pulled from the app store

321
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,760
because it violated their policies.

322
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,520
Also, the guy just has so much opportunity at his other companies.

323
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:36,640
I think at some point he might decide, one, he's very levered and he might decide, okay,

324
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,920
I don't want to make the interest payments and play chicken with the banks. I think there's a

325
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:44,560
chance he loses there and somebody else comes in and buys the debt and bumps him out and bumps

326
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:49,520
him into bankruptcy. I think that if he gets kicked out of the app store, I think at some point he

327
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:56,160
might decide he's had enough. Well, say he folds 10 and the company goes under and it's declared a

328
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:03,040
loss. He will say that advertisers killed the company or it will be seen as he killed the company

329
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:09,920
because he's irresponsible. How would history remember that event if X went down?

330
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:18,160
People have the right to spend money, people and corporations, where they want. And if someone says

331
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:24,320
to you at a meeting, fuck you, you're under no obligation to continue advertising on their

332
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:29,520
platform. As a matter of fact, if you want me to advertise on your platform, I want you to invite

333
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:36,960
me to your big beach party in Cannes and kiss my fucking ass. And that's what they do in order to

334
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:45,360
maybe get some of your ad budget. And somehow his fans have decided that companies have an obligation

335
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:51,840
to kiss his ass and advertise on his platform when their ad might end up next to a swastika.

336
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:58,080
I mean, I know I'm going to take my car to get washed at a place where all the workers throw

337
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:03,680
their rags at me and flip me off and say, you're an idiot. And then if I threaten not to get my

338
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:08,640
car washed at there, they'll say, you took down this car wash. I mean, I realize that's a bad

339
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:16,800
analogy, but anyway, that to me seems literally insane that now advertisers are no longer part of

340
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:21,520
a free capitalist economy and that when they decide not to advertise on a platform,

341
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:28,080
they're the bad guys. Let's move on to our next prediction. Metta's next growth vehicle will be

342
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:33,680
WhatsApp. What potential do you see in WhatsApp? WhatsApp is a phenomenon. They're finally starting

343
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:40,320
to learn how to monetize it. I'm struck by how many people are on WhatsApp. I find myself spending

344
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:45,600
more time on WhatsApp. And to Metta's credit, I mean, the Instagram was the growth story that

345
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:51,440
kept on giving the core platform. Facebook was their cash cow. Instagram was their growth vehicle.

346
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,320
And now they have a second growth vehicle in WhatsApp that I think they will start

347
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:03,680
really turning on the monetization jets in 2024. And arguably, it's the largest telco globally.

348
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:08,960
So what would the five largest telcos be worth if you added them all up? And the answer is a lot

349
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,160
more than Metta's right now. So I think WhatsApp is kind of, I don't want to say overlooked, but

350
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:20,880
that's the new growth vehicle for Metta. US inflation drops to Fed's target of two and

351
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:26,720
a half percent. I think it might even go lower. I see AI as deflationary. Danny Blanchflower,

352
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,840
who we were talking about in the last episode, economist from Dartmouth said there isn't a

353
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,680
modern economy. It hasn't been able to tame inflation because inflation is sort of a

354
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:39,280
self-correcting mechanism where prices go up, dampens demand, it comes down. And I just think

355
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:45,360
AI is going to be everywhere. And per our previous comments, make companies more efficient,

356
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:51,200
more productive, and it'll be so ubiquitous that those cost savings will be passed on to the client

357
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,160
or the customer, which will ultimately deflationary. I also think that the stickiest part of inflation

358
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:03,360
wages will have a psychological dampening effect because I think lawyers, everyone from lawyers to

359
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:09,280
consultants, I think people are just going to be less confident asking for big raises

360
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:14,320
when they see how their company is using AI and do the math and go, they're going to need less of

361
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:21,280
us next year. So I think that we're going to see inflation come below the target next year.

362
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:27,600
And we've got one last prediction, which is a fun one, political prediction. Biden is reelected

363
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:33,760
and Trump is sentenced. Yeah, look, it'd be very unusual. I've said this publicly. I wish

364
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,920
another Democrat was running. I just think it's insane. And we're trying to suspend disbelief in

365
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:42,240
the natural order by electing someone who's going to be 86 the last time he leaves the West Lawn and

366
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,520
Marine one. I think it's ridiculous. Having said that, he surrounds himself with smart people. He's

367
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:55,120
a principled person and he's not a criminal, which draws sharp relief between him and President Trump.

368
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:01,760
And the poll done amongst Republicans found that 7% of the people who are planning to vote for him

369
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,800
would not vote for him if he was in fact convicted. And you think your first reaction, or at least

370
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:13,280
mine was, wow, that just, he has such a heart and base, but that 7% loss would be more than enough to

371
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:18,960
ensure that he doesn't win the presidency. And I think when faced with this revisiting this national

372
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,520
nightmare that is Donald Trump, and I know a lot of people are angry. A lot of people like his,

373
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:31,120
his brand, but I don't see how a president during good economic times and incumbent president loses.

374
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:38,400
And I don't, I just don't see how the odds lead anywhere, but some sort of prison sentence. I

375
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:43,440
just don't think America is going to send someone in an orange suit to the White House.

376
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,160
Just a personal question for me. Do you have a favorite GOP candidate aside from Trump? And if so,

377
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,440
would you ever vote for that candidate over Biden?

378
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,640
I'm a big fan of Governor Haley's. I would like to see, I mean, it's identity politics, but I

379
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:02,320
just think it's strange that what I would argue the most progressive multicultural democracy in

380
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:07,680
the world still has not had a female president. I would enjoy seeing a female president. I think

381
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,600
she's very qualified, foreign policy experience. I think she's a good person. I think she has really

382
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:17,360
shown her mettle on the debate stage. I think she'd be a good president. Anyone who isn't

383
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,200
for reproductive rights. And she's tried to kind of pull back from the issue and say it's up to

384
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,240
the States. I hate when the Republicans do that. It's not up to the States when it comes to guns,

385
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:32,400
but anyways, I, that for me is kind of a deal killer. It would just be very difficult for,

386
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:38,160
for me to vote for someone who in any fashion is not going to fight for a woman's reproductive

387
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,920
rights. I feel like we're taking women back to old Spain. I think it's an affront to decency.

388
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:48,560
And for me, I don't want to say I've become a one issue voter, but I would have a difficult time

389
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:54,880
voting for anyone who constantly talks about how pro life they are. And she's the least crazy of

390
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:01,120
them. But if Biden is the nominee, I will canvas for him. I will give some money and I will do,

391
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:05,760
you know, my part as a citizen to, um, I should probably re register to vote in Nevada or Michigan

392
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,080
or something. We're moving to Detroit, Ed. Team Biden all the way. Team Biden. Yeah. You and I

393
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:18,960
will share a CPAP, maybe bi catheters together. Let's move on before anyone has to picture that.

394
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,120
We're now going to shift it to our listener predictions. We asked for your predictions

395
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:28,800
at the end of last year and you all delivered. My prediction revolves around the 2024 US

396
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:35,280
presidential election. In recent history, the largest third party result was by Ross Perot in

397
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:43,840
1992. He got close to 19% of the vote. I predict that in this upcoming election in 2024,

398
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:50,880
a third party will garner at least 19% and probably surpass that, which would be a first

399
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:57,040
in a long, long time. My prediction is not a fun one, as I believe that in 2024, we will witness

400
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:02,480
the testing of an above ground nuclear bomb. I think there's three scenarios that could spark

401
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:08,320
its return. Number one, Russia could launch one to deter NATO and bring the war in Ukraine to a

402
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:14,160
close with new borders. Number two, Israel could launch one to declare itself as a nuclear power

403
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:20,240
in the face of Iran and its proxies, Hasbullah Hamas and the Houthis. Number three, China could

404
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:25,280
try intimidating Taiwan into peaceful assimilation, knowing that a D-Day style invasion would be

405
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:31,120
catastrophic. I say this as we enter the year that we will celebrate the 80th anniversary of D-Day.

406
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,640
Are we doomed to forget the lessons of that war, especially as so many of the heroic voices from

407
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,520
that generation leave us? Or did I just watch Oppenheimer one too many times this summer?

408
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:53,040
My prediction for 2024 is that the EU electorate has lurched to the right and it's not being picked

409
00:37:53,040 --> 00:38:01,120
up in polls really. But I think it's going to be when voters walk into the voting booth

410
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:06,000
for the EU parliamentary elections coming up this summer, I think that they're going to be

411
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,000
pulling the lever for the candidates on the right side. In 2024, everyone looking ahead is

412
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,280
predicting a kind of immaculate soft landing where inflation cools, but there's no recession.

413
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,400
And I think that's misleading and it's wrong. I think there will be a recession.

414
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,560
My prediction is that in 2024, Scott is going to stop his glory hunting,

415
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:31,200
switching of premiership teams and discover the delights of lower league football.

416
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,120
I predict he's going to head south of the river. He's going to go to Charlton, Millwall or Wimbledon

417
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:41,280
where the football is mediocre, the atmosphere is fun and his bad taste in jokes will be

418
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,800
welcomed for the terrorist chants. I predict that Ed Elson will replace

419
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,400
Professor Galloway on the Prof G-Pod and it will become the Prof E-Pod.

420
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,720
