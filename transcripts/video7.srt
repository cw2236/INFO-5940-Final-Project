1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,760
My name is Scott Galloway. I teach at NYU and it's great to be here. I have 2,700 seconds and 149 slides, so let's light this candle.

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:19,200
I haven't eaten this morning. A lot of people, so I could pass out and throw up. It'll be fine. By the way, isn't it fucking awesome to be together again?

3
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,360
Really, really is nice. And I know I'm in the right place. Thank you, LightClaw!

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Alright, so we'll go through our predictions, then we will talk about silver linings. I naturally see the world as glass half empty, so I try to be positive and force myself to talk about some positive things.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And I'm going to try and wrap up with the question I get most across presentations, and that is, what is the profound opportunity coming out of COVID-19?

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And that's a question that people have been asking for about 18 months because it kept on going.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Some disclosures. These are my stock holdings. Very exciting. Other disclosure, I'm not here with a message of hope, and also I am profane and vulgar.

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It is not an act. I am generally a profane and vulgar person. So just a bit of a time warp. You know, you make plans and then God laughs.

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:29,000
This was my tweet two days before I was supposed to get on a plane for Austin, I guess three years ago now, or excuse me, two years ago.

10
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And I said, I'm coming to Austin. I'm going to shake people's hands. I thought that this whole COVID-19 thing was going to be a big nothing burger.

11
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And if anything, I think a lot of this teaches us humility.

12
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I also said the year before here that Tesla was going to come undone. And I was 100% certain of this.

13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And if you'd listen to me and sold your stock, you'd be pretty angry right now. It didn't get cut in half.

14
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It actually went up 17 fold since I made that prediction. So plans are worthless. Planning is invaluable.

15
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I feel the same way about predictions. Predictions are worthless, but predicting is invaluable because it forces you to think through the notions or the logic to get you there and then look back and say what we got right, what we got wrong, and what happened.

16
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So made these predictions in November. And I want you to keep this in mind because when they come true, they seem less interesting because there's been a series of events that have led up to them.

17
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
But this is when we made these predictions, and that is approximately four months ago. So I'm already wrong.

18
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I predicted that Francis Haugen would be Time's Person of the Year, and that was not correct. I still like to think it happened.

19
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It was Elon Musk. And initially I thought that was a terrible pick. And as I think about it, it is a good pick.

20
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Mr. Musk really does mark the age. Technological brilliance, incredible wealth. 70% of the EV market in the United States is controlled by Tesla.

21
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
There will be more Tesla sold this year in America than Mercedes. Incredible vision. There really is a lot to admire here.

22
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Also, I think it marks the age in sort of a strange way, and that is someone who uses social media to prove to us that his inner child has not developed an outer man.

23
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I think that insulting our elected representatives, phrased it our connective tissue, and it's just generally not good for the Commonwealth.

24
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I have a bias. He has tweeted at me. I said that after this ridiculous poll about whether he should sell Twitter stock,

25
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I found a SEC filing saying that he had filed to sell shares, and this was nothing but a cloud cover and sort of a head fake.

26
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And he tweeted that doing the opposite of whatever that insufferable numbskull says would be a great way to invest.

27
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
This is not true. I am sufferable. I am 100% sufferable.

28
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Next prediction, prediction, fundamentals and valuations reunite stocks and sort of the meme stock movement would come undone.

29
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Again, we said this in November. I think we've gotten this right so far.

30
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This is a list of companies that are lost at least two thirds of their value.

31
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Think about this. Lost two thirds of their value or more, likely just in the last six months.

32
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So look at this list. It's just striking what has happened in the markets.

33
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And there are some fantastic companies here, again, that have lost two thirds of their value since their 52 week high.

34
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So over the last 12 months, if not the last six months, there's also some bad businesses that have lost two thirds of their value

35
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,000
and are still massively overvalued, in my opinion. AMC and GameStop are shitty businesses.

36
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
They are not a movement. They are not a way for you to strike back at an older generation.

37
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You are buying shares in a theater company and a failing retailer.

38
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I think Blackberry, Hertz and Robinhood are still going to decline dramatically.

39
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And I also want to acknowledge that sometimes it is darker before the dawn.

40
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,000
In my view with some of these stocks, sometimes it's darkest before it's pitch black.

41
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I think it's about to get a lot worse for a lot of these firms.

42
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So even at these markdown valuations, you have Tesla trading at 15 times what revenues versus BMW at 1.2,

43
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
AMC at 12 times revenues versus Netflix at 5.6.

44
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So right now, AMC theaters is trading at twice the valuation in terms of the enterprise value to revenues as Netflix.

45
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And GameStop, a struggling retailer, is trading at two and a half times what Best Buy is trading at,

46
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
a thriving juggernaut, very profitable retailer.

47
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Lucid has nearly the market capitalization of Honda, a company that has not shipped a car yet.

48
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
But this isn't a car company, according to these companies.

49
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
They are sustaining life and enchanting future generations, changing.

50
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
This is where Rivian's potential lies. They are combating climate change.

51
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
No, they're bending steel, wrapping it around an electric motor and selling it.

52
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:25,000
There is a level of yoga babble and general bullshit in the marketplace that tries to detach you from your money and from fundamentals to market prices.

53
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
That's part of the problem with crypto is there's no benchmarks or underlying cash flows to value any of this stuff.

54
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And why would you want to be valued like a company that has actual numbers that you have to deliver again?

55
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So instead of talking about we're an automobile company, we're addressing a multi-trillion dollar problem called climate change.

56
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
This is the market cap per car sold.

57
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Daimler-Benz gets about a hundred grand per car in terms of market capitalization.

58
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Rivian, which has not shipped a car yet.

59
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
By the way, I'm on the list of Rivian, 750,000.

60
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And Tesla shareholders afford the company over three million dollars per car shipped in terms of market capitalization.

61
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So these multiples, in my opinion, are not sustainable, especially for companies that haven't shown an ability to ship a car that people will actually enjoy or that doesn't get recalled over and over.

62
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Typically, in this part of the cycles, when we see large retail influx into the market, it kind of signals a top as evidenced by the fact that retail investors are making a disproportionately large part of the market.

63
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm not saying that alternative investment managers or hedge fund managers are any better.

64
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The best way to describe the hedge fund industry over the last 10 years would be expensive, but bad.

65
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But effectively, you do see a cycle when retail investors plow into the market.

66
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It usually signals a top AMC great company, except for the people who know it best, who have all been selling like crazy.

67
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So, no, you should buy my stock, but I'm going to hit the sell button.

68
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Is Robin Hood a growth company? Robin Hood is arguably as a function of its multiples, the most overvalued company in the financial services sector.

69
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And it's no longer growing. As a matter of fact, this is a company that appears to be in decline.

70
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It actually declined. It did not grow in its last quarter, but it's managed to continue scaling its losses.

71
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
These are its active users. This is its revenue per user.

72
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I should point out I have a bias. I think they are mendacious fucks.

73
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Addicting young men under the auspices of learning and investing.

74
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Six out of seven gambling addicts are men.

75
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The addiction with the highest rate of suicide is in fact gambling, because if you get a meth or an alcohol addiction, people intervene.

76
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
People don't know how far deep, how badly you have fucked up your life with gambling addiction.

77
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Be clear, you are not investing. You are not learning. You are gambling, which is fine.

78
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Gambling can be fun, but don't fool yourself.

79
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
What if Robin Hood traded like its peers? It's off two thirds.

80
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I think it could go down another 90 percent.

81
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Its implied valuation based on metrics from other firms that are growing and have much better businesses says that right now it's about 10x trading at 10x the market cap it should be trading at.

82
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Another ridiculous business, space tourism.

83
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I've never seen a company more supply and demand constrained at the same time. Never seen it.

84
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And yet even with this 70 or 80 percent drawdown in its market cap, it is still trading at what is an unattainable or unsustainable multiple.

85
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,000
This is the stock performance over the last three months, and I think it's about to get worse.

86
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
To their credit, this was the ultimate PR move. We've never seen anything like that.

87
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Everyone was watching the Virgin launch. A billion people must have launched that.

88
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And based on that, they have signed up a grand total so far of 600 people.

89
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:14,000
This product makes no sense. People aren't interested in going one fourth thousandth of the distance that three brave people went 50 years ago when America had homes, a third of homes that didn't have indoor plumbing.

90
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:26,000
These are not astronauts. This is not anything resembling an achievement that we haven't achieved in a great exponentially more bravery and scientific innovation than we did 50 years ago.

91
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Sally Ride raised by a minister and a high school teacher risked their lives.

92
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Ph.D.'s and physics. Those are astronauts, not the sons of private equity billionaires.

93
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Virgin gets three million dollars per ticket sold in terms of market capitalization, whereas Aston Martin gets two thousand dollars market cap per car sold.

94
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Space exploration is not space exploration. It's space execution.

95
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'll give you this. On Mars, the view is literally will literally take your breath away.

96
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Because there's no oxygen on Mars. By the way, Texas, I'm pissed off. I was promised beautiful weather. It's 58 degrees. It's minus 112 right now on Mars.

97
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And it's one thing when an astronaut is killed. It's one thing when someone fixing a satellite is killed. It's another thing when Bob from accounting has spent his life savings to be incinerated on a launch pad.

98
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:39,000
This business, this entire sector could go to zero in a flash. Space is not hospitable.

99
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's called space because it doesn't want anything else there, much less a living organism.

100
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Five hundred and fifty people have gone into space. Eleven have not returned. It's got an incredibly high morbidity rates.

101
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:02,000
If you want to do something much safer, try base jumping in space. No one can hear you scream. One of my favorite movies.

102
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It also appears that no one can hear you sell that people who know Virgin Galactic, the best, the biggest investor and the founder have all decided that you should buy their stock, but they're going to sell.

103
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And they have been selling like crazy because they know this company and know this business makes absolutely no sense.

104
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm angry today. I'm angry prediction. I think a lux coin is going to emerge. I think we're going to put we're going to figure out a way to put scarcity on the block chain.

105
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So what would happen if Chanel said anyone who owns our coin and we're only going to issue 10,000 of them gets access to any 10 products across our fashion or jewelry line at any time you get a very high EQ fashion consultant get invited to the coolest, most aspirational fashion events globally.

106
00:12:48,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Literally the perfect gift for your fourth wife. What would that coin? What would that coin go for? Oh, and by the way, only owners of the coin have rights to the IP and visual representation in the metaverse.

107
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You can have Chanel bags or the Chanel logo as your visual metaphor in the metaverse. What would that coin go for? If Chanel announced it was putting out just 10,000 of these coins. That's it.

108
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I don't think it's unreasonable to think this coin would go for 100,000 $500,000. Imagine the speculation it would attract. So overnight, I believe Chanel or a mess could raise 5 to 10 billion dollars trying to monetize this scarcity.

109
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Right now we signal offline with a variety of different products. We signal very much with universities. People say these are the most valuable brands in the world. That's not true. These are the most valuable brands in the world.

110
00:13:39,000 --> 00:14:00,000
No one gives Apple $300 million to put their name on the side of a building in the Cupertino campus. What if Stanford issued a coin? 100,000 coins. You get access to lifelong learning, come to the football games, get to vote on the governance, and also anyone who owns a coin can pick someone to pursue a degree.

111
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Now they have to hit minimum standards. That might sound, that just doesn't make sense. We need an admissions department. The hardest thing about Stanford is getting in. The majority of people who get in graduate. What would that coin go for? Right?

112
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And the bottom line is you'd say, well, that just makes Stanford the domain of the rich. That's called Stanford.

113
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:36,000
There are two cohorts to get into elite universities. The children of rich people, the top 1% income earning households are 77 times more likely to get into an elite university and a small group of what I affectionately call the freakishly remarkable to distract us from the fact that it's mostly rich kids getting in.

114
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:55,000
So let's just be transparent about it. And Becky went to prison, not because she tried to bribe USC with $500,000. She went to prison for cheaping out. If she had offered $5 million, the president of USC would have invited her for a ribbon cutting and all her daughters would have gotten no problem.

115
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:18,000
What would a coin for Jackson Memorial or Mayo or Cedars or the Langone School? What if you said we have a coin cradle to grave world class health care for you and your family? That kind of that would be the ultimate gift from a grandparent to their kids, right? What would that coin go for?

116
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Best health care in the world, no insurance, no payments, texting, best health care professionals in the world. All you need is this coin and your health care for your entire life is covered. By the way, I stopped buying health insurance four years ago. Why? Because I have the financial security to absorb an economic blow from a health scare.

117
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I have saved in the last four years approximately $200,000 by not having health insurance for me and my family that will buy a lot of health care insurance in America is nothing but a transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich because the poor can't absorb that type of risk taking.

118
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:19,000
All kinds of scarcity around coins will emerge. What Coachella is doing, we're only going to see but exponentially. I would imagine South by will do it at some point. Open sea valuation doubles. I'm actually quite bullish on NFTs. We used to meet through friends in bars and restaurants and at school. Now we're all meeting online, especially post COVID.

119
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:36,000
So just as offline, we try and signal and say that if I have ergonomically impossible shoes that gives you the sense I have longer legs, I am more ripe for mating. If I have a Ferrari, it means your kids are less likely to be eaten by a competitor than someone driving a Mazda.

120
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:48,000
We signal these things so we can be more attractive to the other sex and occasionally such that we can feel closer to God. But the signaling is going to increasingly move online, which I think will drive up the value of NFTs.

121
00:16:49,000 --> 00:17:03,000
We're going to see media companies and sports franchises absolutely skyrocket in value because what they are is they're reservoirs of NFTs and they will be able to establish entirely new forms of high margin cash flows.

122
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Sports teams already recognize this about a third of a billion dollars in NFTs and tokens have been sold and they're just getting started. I wouldn't describe them as technically sophisticated.

123
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I think open sea is going to be the big winner here. So far they seem to be by far and away the market share leader and I predicted that their valuation would double in the next 12 months. It's already up 33% and what is a down market.

124
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
So it appears as if we're getting that right. I've been saying for a while that Peloton is going to be acquired.

125
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Really the obvious acquirer for Peloton would be Apple.

126
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I just want to acknowledge that a video above me is like shavings of shit on a shit salad. So I apologize.

127
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:53,000
We predicted this in 2020. Peloton is a metaverse. It's a metaverse of rich people who have an immersive experience trying to enhance their physical fitness.

128
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And so what would you pay for a metaverse that has Beyonce, President Biden and also the most influential people in the world on this thing two to four hours a week.

129
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It'll go down. There's some supply chain problems, but this is an outstanding acquisition. My guess is almost everybody has called them, but insiders control the company.

130
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
So as a result, they don't have to sell and they probably want to wait till the stock price goes up.

131
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
But Apple or Amazon come in and their supply chain problems are over in an instant. This makes this company is a great company.

132
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It's a metaverse on its own and it'll likely be part of a bigger infrastructure within the next 12 months.

133
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I also think kind of the dark horse here might be Nike.

134
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Fintech acquires media firms. So it appears this is happening.

135
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And that is when you have media companies, you have what is effectively incredible, goodwill, high MPS, but you have terrible businesses focused on advertising.

136
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:58,000
The bottom line is, and I say this as a professor of brand strategy, advertising sucks. Advertising has become a tax that the technologically illiterate and the poor have to pay.

137
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
How do you know your life hasn't worked out? You're watching a lot of ads.

138
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Most of us have been able to opt out of advertising, but they create tremendous goodwill and attention, which would be better monetized by a fintech firm.

139
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:23,000
So you're going to start to see a lot of fintech companies with their still overvalued stocks come in and buy media companies and place that goodwill and that attention on top of superior business models.

140
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Yoga Babel. What is the big flowery terminology for 2022? Web 3.

141
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:39,000
A decentralized version of the Internet, where platforms and apps are built and owned by users courtesy of tools including blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and NFTs.

142
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:47,000
A decentralized Internet break away from the stranglehold of Google, Apple, and Meta and these folks that have tried to consolidate our data.

143
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And there's a blockchain advantage and that is power to the people.

144
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I thought this was a great, who would have known that Jack Dorsey would be so good at tweeting? I love this.

145
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Basically said you don't own Web 3, the VCs and their LPs do and they'll never escape their incentives.

146
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And what we see is that just the same level of inequality and centralization is happening in Web 3 as it's happened in Web 1 or Web 2.

147
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And that is only 9% of accounts control 80% of NFTs, 2% of accounts control 95% of Bitcoin.

148
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Someone pointed out that that's not accurate because some of those accounts are custodians.

149
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
So we tried to back that out at a minimum 2% on 72%.

150
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Now you might say, but Scott, 1% of Americans own 90% of the stocks and you'd be right.

151
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
But be clear, there's no power to the people happening here.

152
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
There's the same inequality occurring and the same centralization.

153
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
In addition, middlemen are popping up or middleware and charging fees.

154
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
These are the fees that OpenSea commands.

155
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
And by the way, that means it's worth it.

156
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
We want a certain level of security and we want people to make the difficult easier for us.

157
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Coinbase talks about freedom in almost every tweet they put out.

158
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
They claim there's decentralization, no central authority.

159
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
However, when things get real, they decide to step in and start blocking transactions, which I think is a good thing.

160
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
But be clear, this isn't some sort of decentralized governance.

161
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
At the end of the day, they will step in and make decisions on behalf of all of us.

162
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Also, the notion that it's power to the people.

163
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Dual class shareholder systems are basically an autocracy.

164
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Instead of saying you own what you put at economic risk, you're saying maybe you own 90% of the company and I only own 10, but I want 90% of the power.

165
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It's a weapon of mass entrenchment and the folks at Coinbase have done the same thing and issued themselves super voting shares.

166
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,000
So this is a re-centralization, more like an autocratic government than any sort of power to the people governance.

167
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Dogecoin, the crypto market is more centralized than any financial asset class I have ever seen.

168
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And that is this entire market, a $2-3 trillion market, maybe less now, is largely based on the tweets of one person.

169
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Jerome Powell can't move interest rates and distress credit bonds.

170
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I mean, he can a little bit, but not the way that Elon Musk can.

171
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Oh, so it's a hustle. Yeah, it's a hustle.

172
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I can't just say that, man. Don't fault everybody. It's a hustle.

173
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
To the moon!

174
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Okay, so this is the price of an asset class making a huge movement based on one individual's participation or comments during Weekend Update on a comedy show.

175
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
That's incredible centralization of power. It's also indicative of a market that's not healthy.

176
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
This is Bitcoin's price.

177
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Elon Musk and Tesla sold Bitcoin at a profit to plug a hole in earnings, and once they sold their Bitcoin, they decided it was bad for the environment and started criticizing it and the price responded and declined.

178
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
So who are our new gods?

179
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:08,000
There are crypto bros. They want to tell everyone we are taking back control of the evil wealth-driven ultra-rich so that they too may become ultra-rich.

180
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I don't resent them. There will be some enduring technologies here, but be clear, this isn't Web 3. It's Web 2.0001.

181
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:25,000
By the way, when Harvard rowers who are billionaires tell you to stick it to the man, you're about to take a spear in the chest.

182
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:33,000
These folks are not William Wallace. They are the king's guard. This isn't power to the people.

183
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:41,000
This is my favorite. This is my favorite. And so far we're right. The Zuckerverse fails.

184
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I could not have planned this in my wildest dreams that Mark Zuckerberg would decide that the future of Facebook was around this product that 40 to 60% of people report makes them nauseous.

185
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:03,000
How many people here have AirPods? How many people travel to... I'll participate.

186
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
How many people travel to Austin with some form of a vape or THC product? You're full of shit.

187
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:24,000
How many people have an Oculus here? That's shocking. So I'm learning something. I wouldn't have thought it was that many.

188
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:33,000
That's shocking. I wouldn't have thought it was that many. I'm learning. I still think the thing's going to fail.

189
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Anyways, this is the adoption of other technology products. Really? That many people? You have an Oculus with you?

190
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Oh, at home. Got it. And do you use it for... How do you use it, sir? Never mind. Never mind. Never mind. Go ahead.

191
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Sitting down is going to fall. But do you use it for B2B, B2C, gaming? What do you use it for? Gaming. Thank you.

192
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
So the ultimate test for me on consumer adoption is last year about 70 million Crocs were sold.

193
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:22,000
The Oculus has seen a major uptick in sales, but I still think this product will be probably the tech hardware failure of the last decade.

194
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:31,000
So the good news is that I think this will fail. By the way, this is my metaverse.

195
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:46,000
That's what my creative team did this weekend. What did you do?

196
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:55,000
There already seems to be a reckoning for meta, or the company previously known as Facebook. By the way, I thought that branding was genius.

197
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
We don't want to talk about teen depression. We don't want to talk about weaponization of the elections. We don't want to talk about making our discourse more coarse.

198
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Let's talk about the metaverse. I thought that was a brilliant brand move.

199
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
It's now kind of been kicked out or is no longer welcome at the Cool Girls table in the high school cafeteria.

200
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Really, Facebook is no longer big tech. Nvidia now has a larger market capitalization.

201
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
They've done a terrible job. They've not only not diversified their revenues, their revenues have actually become less diverse.

202
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,000
So who likely will win the metaverse? Who's best positioned for these alternative realities?

203
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
You'd want a ubiquitous device, trust, capital, payments, and programming skills.

204
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Actually, the company that is winning in the metaverse is one we don't talk about, and that is Apple.

205
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:46,000
The metaverse right now, or the closest thing we have to a metaverse, is the app store, where there are 750,000 immersive experiences called apps, and there are 750 new ones every day.

206
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:55,000
In addition, you have with Apple a central server that everyone carries around with them, or the billion wealthiest people in the world, and also a portal.

207
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:03,000
The majority of insight I glean about the metaverse I got with my son watching Loki, but you need to get from one universe to another.

208
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
You need a portal. You need something to pop up seamlessly more from one metaverse to the other.

209
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
And this is the ultimate portal, because most of us are wearing these even in ambient situations.

210
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I find myself just walking around with these on, and these signal that you're wealthy, they signal that you're an artisan, they signal that you're part of an innovation class.

211
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:29,000
And they can take you into other metaverses with your central server. I think this is the metaverse.

212
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,000
In addition, this product is probably the most under-hyped product. The iPhone gets a lot of attention, as do other products.

213
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:45,000
If this product were a standalone company, it would be a Fortune 200 product just behind MasterCard and just ahead of Estee Lauder.

214
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Think about it. This is a Fortune 200 company.

215
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Competitors are responding. You see a lot of people trying to get into the space, acquisitions and patent filings.

216
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:01,000
But still, this is the only wearable that has really worked. No other wearable has really worked other than your iPhone.

217
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:09,000
And I believe wearables, I think people spend a lot of time thinking about how they feel closer to God or more attractive to potential mates.

218
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
And those are the only things they will put on their person and especially their face.

219
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:19,000
AirPods make you more attractive. So does a Rolex. I think this makes you more attractive.

220
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I think this guy is a tall drink of lemonade. And I think we need much sexier elected representatives.

221
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
So I'm down with Beto for purely the wrong reasons.

222
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:40,000
We put sunglasses on our face that accentuate our cheekbones, which supposedly sends a signal to the opposite sex or the same sex that your kids are less likely to have infection.

223
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I think the Oculus is the ultimate prophylactic. I think it ensures no one is going to get near you.

224
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:53,000
And I think it says something about you that you probably, probably like me, lost your virginity at 19.

225
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Other prophylactics. Pay for dinner tonight with a Discover card.

226
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Roll up in a Mazda. Talk incessantly about your magic.

227
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Okay. I thought that'd be funnier. The metaverse is not going to be this.

228
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
He's called the Oasis.

229
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I don't think it's going to be visual. I think the metaverse is going to be less like Ready Player One or The Matrix.

230
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
And it's going to be more like the movie Her.

231
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Email from Mark Looming. What are you talking about?

232
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Read email.

233
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Okay, I will read email for Theodore.

234
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I think it's going to be in your ears.

235
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:41,000
And the reason why I think it's in your ears is actually personal experience. If someone comes up to me and high fives me and says, Prof G, I know they saw a video.

236
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
If someone writes me a very long email, I know they've read something I've written. The medium really is the message.

237
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:54,000
When people come up to me and this literally happened to me about 20 minutes ago and start talking to me as if we're friends and I think, oh God, I don't remember this person.

238
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
It's because they listen to the podcast in their ears.

239
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:12,000
So there's something about having audio or a device actually in your ears that creates a level of intimacy, engagement, and I also think addiction that will drive the metaverse more than visuals.

240
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Super app. The race for super app is kind of on.

241
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:25,000
And Google and Apple have a vested interest in ensuring a super app never emerges because they want iOS and Android effectively to be the super app.

242
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:33,000
But the idea is a Swiss army knife of the Internet or one interface, one user interface for all of your digital life.

243
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
And there's sort of above the fold here, the super apps.

244
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
They're typically the most valuable company in that market. And then below that fold here are the super hopefuls.

245
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:49,000
It trifurcates into transportation, social and payments are usually the legs of the super app stool.

246
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
And we see WeChat and Paytm have done a good job.

247
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:01,000
The reason you want a super app is that if you can capture that much attention, you your market capitalization and your stakeholder value absolutely skyrockets.

248
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Big tech has recognized the power of super apps.

249
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
And just as a lot of firms recruit out of big tech, big tech is now recruiting out of super app companies.

250
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Google has recruited 300 people out of Tencent and Alibaba.

251
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Just in the last five years and about 200 of those just in the last 24 months.

252
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:26,000
A dark horse for this Uber could somebody is going to get into super app through either transportation or payments or social.

253
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Uber is clearly trying to head this way.

254
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
We want to be the Amazon of transportation.

255
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
It is now actually a food delivery company.

256
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
They garnered more revenues from food delivery last year than moving people around.

257
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I believe Twitter and Pinterest will be acquired because they are effectively cheap legs of the stool for a super app company.

258
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,000
If Tencent were to come in and buy Twitter, overnight it becomes the leading super app company in the United States.

259
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:02,000
The company that is able to establish super app status in the United States kind of overnight probably comes one of the ten if not one of the five most valuable companies in the world.

260
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,000
And these two are now fairly inexpensive ways to offer the social component of that Swiss army knife.

261
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
These are the companies that will likely buy either Twitter or Pinterest.

262
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Keep in mind when Salesforce tried to buy Twitter four years ago, it would have been a 20 or 30 percent dilution.

263
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Now it is less than 10 percent.

264
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
It is a very small company.

265
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
It is a very small company.

266
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I love cities.

267
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I am fascinated by migration patterns.

268
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
We have heard a lot about Austin.

269
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
How many people are moving here?

270
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
How many people are moving to Miami?

271
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I think the city of the future if you will are the new hot spot.

272
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I think the city of the future is not just a very small city.

273
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
You know, not as big as it was in the early eighties.

274
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
You know, it is not as big as it was in the early eighties.

275
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
But it is the city of the future.

276
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
It is the city of the future.

277
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,200
city of the future, if you will, or the new hot city in North America, is Mexico City.

278
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:10,200
Wow, I'll do that again. Mexico City. Why? It's a wonderful place to visit. I have a

279
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,400
personal affection for Mexico. I go there several times a year. It's got fantastic

280
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,440
density. Density is equal to opportunity. Opportunities around money, opportunities

281
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:23,800
around meaning, opportunities around art is a function of density. In addition, it's

282
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:28,120
attracting a lot of remote workers because of the great quality of life. And they don't

283
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:38,120
have their head up their ass. They have 99% vaccination rates. Hello, Texas. I think the

284
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:42,400
gap will continue to narrow in terms of trade. My colleague at NYU, Pankaj Jemmowat, has

285
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:47,440
done some great research here. Trade is a function of proximity. And that is typically

286
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:52,200
your biggest trading partners are the ones on your borders. And our biggest trading partner

287
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:57,940
is Canada. Right? It's not China. And yet we tend to think of everything in the context

288
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:04,560
of shipping oil from Russia. No, we get 1% or 3% of our oil from Russia representing

289
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:10,980
1% of their exports. Trade is a function of proximity. The market is heating up for startups

290
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:17,700
in Mexico. They now have more fintech startups than Brazil, the largest economy outside of

291
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:23,380
the U.S. and Canada. And they have some great companies that are getting a lot of attention.

292
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:28,860
And typically you don't hear, you didn't hear a lot of Mexican companies being bandied about

293
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:32,540
in kind of the innovation conferences. And increasingly we're starting to see these native

294
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:41,740
Mexican companies seen as sort of these really exciting unicorns. So bonus round, the biggest

295
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:46,940
LBO of 2022. I'm really excited about this. And I think it's, or excited about the prediction

296
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:51,300
because I think it's happening. And that is if you look at, we like to think that all

297
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:56,220
of these sanctions are going to absolutely destroy Russia. There's some truth to that.

298
00:34:56,220 --> 00:35:01,060
But the unfortunate news is Russia has a natural hedge because as many people pointed out,

299
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,740
it's basically an economy sitting on top of a gas station. A tremendous amount of their

300
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:11,460
revenues come from oil and oil has skyrocketed. So they still have massive cash flows. It's

301
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:17,800
also a very liquid market. And that is even if we put sanctions on them, there will likely

302
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:23,700
always be a buyer for oil. It may get more difficult in terms of supply chain, but there's,

303
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:28,060
this is trying to hold water in someone's hand. They're going to be able to find buyers

304
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:33,900
for this. And we see tremendous cash flows, especially with the increase in oil prices.

305
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:39,780
So the question is, what will Putin do with this consistent source of cash flow in default

306
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:45,740
currencies? He'll be able to find some type of currency to buy other things. I think he's

307
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:51,340
going to diminish certain oligarchs and raise new ones. And that is I think the biggest LBO

308
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:56,520
is that Putin is about to take the 10 or 15 biggest Russian companies private and say,

309
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:00,600
congratulations, I'm privatizing you for 10 cents on the dollar because the crash in the

310
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:06,680
ruble and the crash in these stocks has taken what are some very strong firms down 90, 95%.

311
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:12,320
And he's just going to nationalize them. And what good oligarchs do is they reward their allies.

312
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:17,200
Roman Abramovich, I don't think is likely a genius business person. He just happened to be

313
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,880
Yeltsin's roommate and talked him into making Putin the head of Russia. And in exchange,

314
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:27,040
he was awarded with 10s of billions of dollars. I believe and at the same time, Putin came to power

315
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:32,280
by diminishing certain oligarchs and then ascending others. And I think that cycle is about to start

316
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:38,120
over. And that is he will descend or diminish certain wealth across oligarchs, say, sorry,

317
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:42,760
you're no longer a 10 billion, just a billion. I'm taking back your company. And then he's going to

318
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:47,940
reissue those companies to a new set of oligarchs. I think we're going to have the first billionaire

319
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:53,460
influencer come out of Western Europe or Russia, who is very pro Putin. And Putin is going to decide

320
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:59,140
to give this person the biggest nickel factory in Irkutsk in exchange for promoting his propaganda

321
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:06,340
and his lies. Okay, so let's summarize. Francis Hogan is Times Person of the Year. I got that wrong.

322
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:12,900
Fundamentals and valuations reunite. That appears to be happening violently. Open Sea valuation

323
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:18,580
doubles. We're well on our way. A lux coin emerges. Scarcity is going to move to the blockchain. I

324
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:23,300
think we're going to see that across a luxury brand. I've been contacted by several luxury brands who

325
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:30,740
are very intoxicated by the notion of coming up with 10 billion dollars overnight. Fintech acquire

326
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:36,980
media firms, even with the huge drawdown in Fintech valuations, they still can pick up a variety of

327
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:42,260
these firms, media firms for pennies on the dollar. Peloton has acquired, I've been saying this for two

328
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:47,620
and a half years. At some point, I think I'm going to be right. The new Yoga Babel is Web 3. The great

329
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:52,020
decentralization is nothing but continued re-centralization of wealth at the hands of

330
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:58,180
decentralized products. The business world of 2022 is super-rap. I believe the Zuckerverse, as

331
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:05,140
currently envisioned, will fail. The new Miami and Austin is Mexico City. And I think that Putin is

332
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:10,500
undertaking what will be the largest historical leverage buyout in history. Take Russian companies

333
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:16,580
private and then redistribute them to a new set of oligarchs who are supportive of his current agenda

334
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:24,100
using new technologies. I want to talk about some silver linings. Very difficult to process what has

335
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:30,100
happened. We have lost more people from COVID than all Americans in combat deaths combined in every

336
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:34,820
conflict so far. Statisticians will point out that's not apples to apples because we use we lose

337
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:39,620
younger people in combat and as a percentage of population. But still, this is hopefully what

338
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:47,380
will be seen as the seminal crisis in our lifetime. There's tremendous silver linings, a dispersion away

339
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:55,300
of healthcare from hospitals and doctors offices to our smartphones. 99% of the people who contracted

340
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,740
endured and developed antibodies to the novel coronavirus never entered a doctor's office,

341
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:04,420
much less a hospital. This represents an opportunity to push primary healthcare out to tens of millions

342
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:10,020
of Americans who are either intimidated or don't have the economic resources to address

343
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:14,980
healthcare in an offensive, health driven way and end up in the emergency room. This could be a huge

344
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:21,060
unlock. My industry should and hopefully will move away from a rejectionist culture where me and my

345
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:25,940
colleagues decide to turn away 90% of applicants, which in my view is tantamount to bragging about

346
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:31,940
turning away nine in 10 people who show up at a homeless shelter. We have become so drunk on our

347
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:36,500
own arrogance and self aggrandizement that we are no longer Americans and don't see ourselves as

348
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:43,780
public servants, but as a fucking Hermes bag. UBI is finally getting some form of traction and that

349
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:48,900
is we've decided that if we can cut child poverty in half by just cutting people checks who live

350
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:55,140
under a certain income line, who would have thought that we just what appears to be about three days

351
00:39:55,140 --> 00:40:00,500
of COVID bailout funds, we could cut child poverty in half. There's tremendous unlocks. We might

352
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:07,140
unleash an incredible new dawn of healthcare with vaccines that could prevent tens of millions of

353
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:13,380
preventable deaths around the world. We're going to save billions of hours in commuting and putting

354
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:20,500
on makeup and putting on a pantsuit, blow drying our hair. Even if we do what Apple is suggesting

355
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:25,860
and only come back to the office two or three days a week, you're going to save billions of hours for

356
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:30,420
self care, caring for others or making more money. There's tremendous unlocks that are going to come

357
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:36,340
out of the novel coronavirus. For the first time we seem to have unity across the West because of

358
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:41,460
a foreign invader. NATO has new life. It was suffering from what was brain death trying to

359
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:45,140
figure out what they were supposed to do. It appears for the first time in a long time they

360
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:51,540
have purpose. We are seeing that the wonderful thing about capitalism is it has connective tissue

361
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:55,700
and that once you get really rich you want to party in St. Barts and not in Odessa and we can

362
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:59,220
take that shit away from you if you don't behave like a global citizen.

363
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:12,820
Difficult segue. I have presented to 116,000 people across 104 venues, 101 of them, 100 of them

364
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:20,580
remote over the last 12 months and the question I get the most is what is the profound opportunity

365
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:26,420
coming out of COVID? What's the big unlock coming out of COVID-19?

366
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:31,300
And people think I'm going to talk about investing and Web 3. I believe this is the unlock

367
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:38,180
and I presented to a variety of organizations. I struggle with happiness which probably doesn't

368
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:43,060
come as a big surprise. I have blessings of this. I have happiness of this. So I wrote a book on

369
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:49,060
happiness because I wanted to try and figure it out and across every major study on happiness,

370
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:55,460
everything distills down to one thing and that is the number of deep and meaningful relationships

371
00:41:55,460 --> 00:42:00,340
you have. Period. Full stop. Across income, demographic and cultural groups.

372
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:04,980
Amongst your friends do you feel a sense of joy and camaraderie and just as importantly do you

373
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:11,860
know they get joy and camaraderie from you? Across work do you feel respected and admired

374
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:16,660
and do you respect and admire other people? And with your family or within your family do you feel

375
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:22,660
intense levels of support and just as importantly do you know they know they are intensely loved

376
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:28,980
and supported by you? So I have ended every presentation and I'm committed to having this

377
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:34,980
be the last slide of every presentation I've done until the pandemic goes endemic. So hopefully this

378
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:41,220
slide will not be up for much longer but what I encourage people to do is to recognize that the

379
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:47,140
opportunity is to establish or accomplish in weeks what otherwise might take years and that is the

380
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:53,460
repair and cementing of key relationships. People remember how you behave in a crisis.

381
00:42:55,700 --> 00:43:00,660
We give medals and ribbons to young people who effectively demonstrate grace and courage under

382
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:07,140
fire when shit gets real when their life is on the line. This is how you will be remembered,

383
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:13,940
how you behave during a crisis. So three questions. One, is this an opportunity

384
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:21,460
to pivot to becoming a caregiver for somebody? Two, do you have the relationship with your

385
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:25,860
siblings that you want? If you've been one of the hundreds of thousands of people who had to accept

386
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:31,060
a call over FaceTime and say final words to a sibling, is your relationship where you want it

387
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:36,900
to be? And then finally, have you made the requisite investments in friendships or have

388
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:44,260
you let competitiveness or perceived slights or other bullshit get in the way? That is the unlock

389
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:50,260
is we can accomplish potentially in weeks what otherwise might take years and that is for the

390
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:57,140
cementing and repair of key relationships. My name is Scott Galloway at Teach at NYU and I appreciate your time.

391
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:07,140
Thank you.
