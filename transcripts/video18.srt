1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,180
What's super interesting here, and it kind of chills down my spine thinking about it,

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:10,200
is that essentially it's going to become more human-like.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,600
When you think about why you go to the media, you go for news, right?

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,200
But almost everyone has access to the same news, unless you're spreading misinformation

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,680
or disinformation, which is kind of their new go-to so they can pretend it's news and

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,200
act like they've discovered something new and they haven't, they just made up something.

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,000
Oh, Dominion voting machines are linked to Hugo Chavez.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,640
No, that's not news, that's a lie.

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,520
But real news is very hard to find, and it's very difficult to differentiate a media product

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,520
on news, right?

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,920
We don't differentiate on news.

12
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,880
We take other people's news and try and provide some insight or perspective, which is really

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,360
just Latin for voice.

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:48,680
Most people go to a media outlet for voice, and that is a take on things or insight or

15
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,280
humor or no voice.

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,560
I really like Reuters because I find Reuters is kind of just the facts, ma'am, right?

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,320
I also like The Economist because I find it very dry and looks at stuff through sort of

18
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,240
a capitalist lens.

19
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:07,800
Anyways, what it got me thinking about is the voice, if you will have chat GPT for Omni

20
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:15,320
or O, every morning I could just say, hey, give me today's business news in the voice

21
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:21,460
of Reuters, and I'll be able to say it just similar to what I used to do with Alexa.

22
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:25,120
And what this does is it's going to fulfill the dream of these big tech firms that are

23
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:30,920
increasingly consolidated, and that is what Google hated was that you left Google.

24
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,720
You type in lowest airfare from New York to St. Barts, right?

25
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,940
And it would bring up a bunch of paid for sites, including United, including JetBlue,

26
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,520
and then you would leave and go to JetBlue.

27
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,900
And then I said, no, no, no, we don't want anyone leaving.

28
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:50,000
So they started sending you to other components of Google, and Google has Google Flight or

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,440
Google Travel so they could further monetize it.

30
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:58,400
I think this could be really bad news for media organizations because at some point

31
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:04,680
it just might be easier for me to go, give me a view on campus protests in the voice

32
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,840
of Anderson Cooper, and I won't need to go to the CNN site.

33
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,280
It'll just keep me right there.
