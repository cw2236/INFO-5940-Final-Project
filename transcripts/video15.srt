00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Over the next 12 months, the biggest IPOs of 2024 and 2025 are going to happen on the LSE and a new exchange in America.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Specifically, the biggest IPO of 2024 is going to happen on the LSE from Shien, the company that's gone up from $30 to $42 billion.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Next year, it'll probably be $60 billion. It'll probably be the biggest apparel company in the world that's growing that fast and is that profitable.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And similar to Nvidia, it doesn't have any actual assets.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's just essentially AI or software figuring out how to figure out a way to get you your stuff more inexpensively.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And then the biggest IPO of 2025 will be SpaceX on the new Texas exchange.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So we're about to see what I would loosely call exchange wars and Raspberry Pi, which decided to go public on the LSE last week.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This is a cool little company actually chose the LSE.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So the LSE is no longer going to be seen as the exchange of last choice.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's going to be something where cool companies go public.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
That is going to add $5 or $10 billion in market cap to Shien, which people see as going to the LSE only because they have to.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And then you can bet Elon Musk is in the background on this new Texas exchange.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And the first, the biggest IPO of 2025 will be SpaceX on the new Texas exchange.
