00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
Scott Galloway is professor of marketing at NYU School of Business.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:09,320
He writes of 2021 the year of the bubble 2022 maybe year of the pop.

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,280
He's with me from New York.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,800
Everybody wants to know.

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,680
And I realize that at five o'clock your your predictions for this year,

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,560
you will be releasing them and you'll be releasing them in a stream, a live stream.

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,760
And we'll be showing the where people can watch those those predictions.

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,360
If you had to get before we get to next year,

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,600
if you had to gauge your successes from last year on your predictions, what do you think?

10
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,280
Better to be lucky than good. This year, things worked out.

11
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,360
We predicted that Bitcoin would hit fifty thousand dollars.

12
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,400
We predicted that there would be

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,360
that AT&T would divest assets, that CNN would go behind a paywall

14
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,360
and that Jack Dorsey would be ousted from Twitter.

15
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,200
What we didn't get right, we thought Peloton would be acquired.

16
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,680
But I think we got about seven of the ten correct.

17
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,120
So last year, last year we did all right, Richard.

18
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,520
All right. Now then, what about this year?

19
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,880
I see that your real real main predictions are coming out shortly.

20
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,880
But you're basically saying that I'm reading from the Zuckerverse

21
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,440
is the biggest tech fallout that is going to be.

22
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,080
Yeah, I think that so there are already several metaverses,

23
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,680
whether it's Twitter or Fortnite or FIFA.

24
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,840
We have a lot of metaverses that already exist.

25
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,280
But one of the keys to a metaverse, if you think about a metaverse,

26
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,720
is a series of Internet services connected together

27
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:42,080
by one operating system that kind of permeates geographic boundaries.

28
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,320
The key to it is a portal, and that is entry into a different universe.

29
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,240
And the App Store is entry into a bunch of different metaverses.

30
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,640
And I think the reason the Facebook metaverse or the Zuckerverse, if you will,

31
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,480
is going to fail is that the Oculus is selling somewhere between three

32
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,840
and five million units. There were 60 million pairs of Crocs sold last year.

33
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,760
There were one hundred and thirty million AirPods sold.

34
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,440
It's it's this thing, the central server and then the AirPods

35
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,720
that are going to be your portal to other universes.

36
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,560
So I think the metaverse will be a big deal,

37
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,880
but I think it's going to be the Appleverse, not the Zuckerverse.

38
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,320
I think the Oculus is more prophylactic, Richard,

39
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,720
ensuring no one will get near you. Right.

40
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,200
But the reality is that

41
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,920
we if one looks at the market overall,

42
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,800
and I've got a dozen people now on this program, all who are saying

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,640
there's something smelly and it's going to go wrong next year.

44
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,760
You talk about the bubble and the pop.

45
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,880
But what does that mean in reality for ordinary people?

46
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,960
What does that mean?

47
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,000
That's a correct question. I want to be clear.

48
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,040
It's it's it's you know, economists have predicted nine of the last three

49
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,760
recessions and seven of the last three corrections.

50
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,360
And the bottom line is, I don't know.

51
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,360
We know that 2000 is coming or we're fairly confident.

52
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,600
2000 is coming. The question is, is it 1997 right now or 1999?

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,240
I do think you're seeing a reattachment to fundamentals,

54
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,760
especially among meme stocks, where people are deciding that

55
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,360
a theater chain is probably not worth more

56
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,160
than many media companies that have much more robust businesses.

57
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,280
That GameStop probably isn't worth more than a lot of very profitable,

58
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,840
growing retailers.

59
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,880
So I think you're probably going to see a reattachment to fundamentals,

60
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:33,440
which over the long haul or even the medium term seem to rear that ugly head.

61
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,040
Now, whether that happens this quarter or in three quarters,

62
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,360
you could argue it's already happening, Richard.

63
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,960
Most SPACs are well off their 50 week highs.

64
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,560
I think over half of them are more than 50 percent off their 52 week highs.

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,080
But it does feel like we're in the midst of a reattachment to fundamentals.

66
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,880
You see, I don't know.

67
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,480
One could argue and just I mean, never mind that the Dow is at the record today.

68
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,040
If you look at the components and you look at the Nvidia's,

69
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:03,840
you look at Microsoft, you look at snaps and Twitter's, they are down 30, 40, 50, 40 percent.

70
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,120
So there's a strong argument for saying, if this isn't the pop,

71
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,600
I don't think I want to see it when it happens.

72
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,840
Oh, yeah. But I mean, and I get a lot of grief for this.

73
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,400
But Richard, keep in mind, Tesla could drop 80 percent

74
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,640
and it would still be worth more than General Motors and Ford combined.

75
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:29,040
The the electric vehicle market, if you take Tesla, Rivian and Lucid

76
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,840
are worth more than I think the top eight automobile manufacturers

77
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,640
and throwing Boeing and Airbus.

78
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,400
So there's a lot of air that could still be let out of this balloon.

79
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:45,520
How do you how do you then properly value these stocks

80
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:52,440
other than the old fashioned way, earnings per share, future earnings stream,

81
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,840
all the things that are very unfashionable?

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,360
Well, again, this is going to sound like a boomer, a boomer comment, Richard.

83
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,080
And I think you and I are about the same age.

84
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,040
I think fundamentals over the long term,

85
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,400
I think fundamentals over the long term are going to rear their rear their heads again.

86
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,480
What's typically happened is that throughout the history of the Dow,

87
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:20,080
most of the time, there's a difference between pricing and valuation.

88
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,600
And the pricing recently has been more a function of kind of 80 percent story

89
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,960
and 20 percent fundamentals for most of these stocks.

90
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,880
And typically throughout history, most companies have a set of peers that

91
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,640
and they trade within a certain range based on the kind of vision of the CEO.

92
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,800
And it's somewhat flipped.

93
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,040
Now there's literally story stocks where it's almost impossible.

94
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,960
I mean, Rivian hasn't delivered a car yet and it has about the value of General Motors.

95
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,040
So it's become all about story.

96
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,080
So I wonder if we're going to flip back to less about the story

97
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,480
and more about the fundamentals.

98
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,640
And also, stocks tend to trade the most vulnerable stocks, I believe.

99
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,280
They usually trade on fundamentals or technicals or short squeeze, what have you.

100
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,160
But we have this new phenomena of kind of a mob squeeze or they trade on movement.

101
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:16,520
I wonder if the stocks driven by movements, if you will, or so-called movements in 2021

102
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,840
are going to are going to register the greatest pain.

103
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,920
We'll be watching closely.

104
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,760
WWW ProfGalloway.com.

105
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,880
Five o'clock, you'll have the predictions.

106
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,240
I do like the way you have the predictions.

107
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,560
And also, you're quite open about how well or badly you did.

108
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,880
And by the way, the beauty of Google.

109
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,640
No, I'm older than you, Scott.

110
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,200
I've got two years on you.

111
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,000
I'll be 60 this year.

112
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,440
You will merely be a young 58.

113
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,080
There you go. There you go.

114
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,560
I can learn a lot from you, Richard.

115
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,440
Happy birthday.

116
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,800
On the. I think it's the other way around.

117
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,120
I'm into no illusions about that, Scott.

118
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,680
Thank you, Professor. Good to have you with us.
