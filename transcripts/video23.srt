1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
You have predicted that Biden

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,740
will be re-elected and Trump

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,980
will go to jail in 2024.

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,680
How short can you be?

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,700
Why are you saying that?

6
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,540
Well, I don't think you can be

7
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,300
sure.

8
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,040
If you look at the

9
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,500
jurisdictions he's been charged

10
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,840
in, they have between a 70%

11
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,100
and 92% conviction rate,

12
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,440
and only a third of people who

13
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,800
receive the indictments

14
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,740
or the charges that he's

15
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:22,980
received don't end up

16
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,200
with prison time.

17
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,600
So even if you were to discount

18
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,840
those statistics or cut them

19
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,080
in half, because it is

20
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,640
a different situation,

21
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,520
it just seems mathematically

22
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,940
improbable that he won't be

23
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,140
sentenced to prison at some

24
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:34,440
point.

25
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,680
So it's become a bit of a game

26
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,580
show, and that is his objective

27
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,720
is to slow down the trials

28
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,780
until after.

29
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,340
But if you look at

30
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,780
statistically the likelihood

31
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,340
that one of these 93 charges

32
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,520
will stick, it just feels

33
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,420
mathematically likely something

34
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,220
is going to stick here.

35
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,780
So they say 91, but nonetheless,

36
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:53,880
we're just nitpicking here.

37
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,120
Thank you.

38
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,340
And you think these trials,

39
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,380
at least one of them,

40
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,520
will come to fruition

41
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,160
and sentencing before the election?

42
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:02,860
I think we'll find out

43
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,360
in the next couple of months.
