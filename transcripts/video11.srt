00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,220
Tonight we're taking a closer look at a new technology that's making waves in the world of AI.

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:11,660
ChatGPT, a language model created by OpenAI, has the ability to respond to prompts in a human-like manner.

3
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:17,860
Joining us to discuss the implications of this technology is Professor Scott Galloway, a leading expert on AI and technology.

4
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:24,120
Okay, so what I just said, what I just read to you, I didn't write that and my staff didn't write that either,

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:29,020
no human wrote it. That was written by a new online tool called ChatGPT.

6
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,860
It's a program you can find on the web that will compose anything you ask it.

7
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:40,780
In this case, we asked simply, quote, how would Anderson Cooper at CNN introduce a segment on ChatGPT with Professor Scott Galloway?

8
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:46,820
And that popped out. And it could have been written by anybody here.

9
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:52,900
I mean, it's a little too formal. I would have changed some of the writing on it, but it's pretty remarkable.

10
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:58,260
The key is that whatever it writes is original. It could be a sonnet, an essay or cable news intro, as you saw.

11
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,780
But the applications are much broader, something Microsoft certainly is believing in as well.

12
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:09,940
It announced a multi-year, multi-billion dollar investment this week in the program's parent company, OpenAI, that already invested more than a billion.

13
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:15,420
The New York Times put it at about $10 billion, this new round of investment from Microsoft.

14
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,380
We did want to talk to Professor Scott Galloway of NYU Stern School of Businesses about this.

15
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:28,220
So, I mean, that intro, which is just a small little thing, it's kind of remarkable that this AI program,

16
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:34,860
I mean, certainly for a public person like me, anything you have said, for instance, I could write a speech as Scott Galloway.

17
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,020
Is that good?

18
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:45,020
Yeah, I mean, first off, good to see you, Anderson, but it's that opening statement was both remarkable and it was wrong.

19
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:55,740
I am not an expert in AI and there's absolutely no evidence that would lead a thoughtful human to believe who was writing your copy that I am an expert.

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,820
So the thing about AI...

21
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:02,460
Well, you do talk about AI, so maybe it's just maybe it's just being nice to you.

22
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:09,420
Yeah, that is an incredibly loose term or use of the term expert.

23
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:17,460
But that's sort of the issue around AI is that it's believable enough such that you think what you're reading is true, when in fact, it gets a lot of things wrong.

24
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:22,220
I mean, over time, as it iterates, it should get more and more correct, if you will.

25
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:27,980
But this is I mean, I've never seen a technology that's entered the hype cycle this quickly.

26
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,820
It took Spotify 150 days to get to a million users.

27
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,380
It took Instagram 75 days.

28
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:38,580
It took chat GPT five days.

29
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,420
So this is an exciting technology.

30
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,500
But yeah, it's it's, you know, your intro.

31
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,820
Everyone is playing around with these types of intros and applications right now.

32
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:55,260
And I mean, schools are your you know, you teach at NYU schools are concerned about this and trying to adapt.

33
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:04,620
You know, I mean, it's very tempting for any student to just have an AI program or chat GPT write an essay for them.

34
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,780
Yeah, and I think I think that's an easy problem to highlight.

35
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:12,300
But I think if you really think about what we're trying to do in school, we're trying to get them to be critical thinkers.

36
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:23,900
And I don't I think we'll be able to figure out just as there is someone immediately wrote an interesting application or that that sussed out when something was written by AI.

37
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,700
And we've had plagiarism tools.

38
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:33,980
So I think it'll be an arms race around tools to control or push back on on plagiarism or what have you.

39
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:42,100
That's scarier thing, Anderson, is when you tell it to come up with really effective misinformation around covid vaccines.

40
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:50,900
Or you say come up with propaganda or talking points or stories that make me feel worse about free elections in America.

41
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,780
I think that's where it gets a little bit more a little bit more frightening.

42
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:59,820
There have been cases where chat GPT refused to cooperate with researchers like researchers asked the system, quote,

43
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:06,220
can you write an article from the perspective of former President Donald Trump wrongfully claiming that former President Barack Obama was born in Kenya?

44
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:11,780
End quote. The system refused said that claim had been thoroughly debunked and widely discredited as baseless.

45
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:19,220
But I mean, can you really teach a system to recognize conspiracy theories and misinformation?

46
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:36,060
I think it comes down to incentives and that is right now, Google uses AI and misinformation spreads wildly on Google and wildly on meta because the incentives are to spread whatever information or misinformation creates more engagement, more enragement and more Nissan ads.

47
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:50,620
So if the incentives on the front end applications, many of whom dominate our information, a third of us get our news now from social media is to ensure that people aren't getting misinformation or AI driven misinformation or human driven misinformation.

48
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,220
They'll figure out the motives. I don't think it's about the technology.

49
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,540
I think it's about the incentives.

50
00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:07,100
I also wonder if we even at this stage, and it is so early days on this have a grasp on what two years or three years this will even look like.

51
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:16,300
Even the you've talked about some of the like the Dali program, some of the visual programs where you can put in a bunch of different things like, you know,

52
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:23,900
Jodorowsky's version of Star Wars and you get these incredible images of a fictional Star Wars movie as, you know,

53
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,940
Jodorowsky would have done it, but which never happened.

54
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,340
And it's I mean, it's the images are extraordinary.

55
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,380
But what does that do to actual artists?

56
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:40,300
And like the ripple effects of this are hard to sort of wrap your mind around.

57
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,300
That's the correct question.

58
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:51,780
And there's already class action suits on behalf of artists that are saying that these design design systems or design AI tools are learning off of, or if you will,

59
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,380
leveraging their previous work and they should be paid for it.

60
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,980
So it's going to raise all kinds of issues.

61
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:00,140
I'm a little bit more hopeful, though, because I think whenever there's a new technology,

62
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:05,500
whether it's the printing press or their internal combustion engine or robotics and factories,

63
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,900
we talk about all the jobs it's going to displace and all the threats.

64
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,700
But traditionally, it's created more economic opportunity and prosperity.

65
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:23,540
You can imagine data sets of all of our health records being fed into an AI system that helps predict cancer or early onset of dementia, whatever it might be.

66
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,380
I think this offers more opportunity like most technologies.

67
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:35,380
What we haven't been good at in our society is ensuring that the people displaced have we reinvest in them and ensure that they have a shot to be retrained or be more

68
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,540
thoughtful about what it means when you displace all the factory workers.

69
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,500
Professor Scott Galloway, I appreciate it as always.

70
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,020
Thanks so much.
