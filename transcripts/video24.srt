1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,280
I think we're going to see a narrative and some evidence that these GLP-1 drugs that reduce your cravings,

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:11,280
the people on these drugs are actually consuming less social media.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,320
There is a cohort of people that are on social media 24 by 7.

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:24,200
And whether it's porn, whether it's Instagram, whether it's TikTok or Twitter,

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,960
it is an addiction and that is it gets in the way of the rest of your life.

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,920
And I think we're going to find that people on these drugs reduce their social media consumption,

7
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,240
among other addictions, and I wonder how the market is going to react to that.

8
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:42,200
So I think that's coming. I think we're going to start to see news in addition to reducing your nail biting,

9
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,240
your alcohol consumption, your consumption of Pringles.

10
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,400
You're also less likely to be on Instagram 14 hours a day.
