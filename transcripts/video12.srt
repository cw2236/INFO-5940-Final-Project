1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,700
The prediction is the following. By November the 7th or 10th, let's assume this election is going to be challenged by everybody.

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:13,200
Between now and November the 10th, Donald Trump media, which I think is around 30 bucks, will either be below 10 or above 80.

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:21,100
This thing has become a literally the tail of the whip on the prospects of Donald Trump recapturing the White House.

4
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:28,300
The most volatile stock over the next few weeks is going to be Donald Trump media, which attempts to absorb a million points of light

5
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:36,500
and guess as to whether he's going to be in the White House. This thing, 30 now, it's going to be below 10 or above 80 within three weeks.

6
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:42,700
I find it just super interesting. It's literally, in my opinion, it's a more robust poll than Quinnipac.
