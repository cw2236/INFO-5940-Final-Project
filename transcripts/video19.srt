One thing that's overhyped, I love talking about overhyped technology, on this stage

00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,520
I said 3D printing, wearables, VR were all overhyped.

00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,920
I think the new big overhyped one is self-driving.

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,200
I don't think, according to Elon Musk, three years ago or two and a half years ago, within

00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,640
a year there were going to be a million self-driving Teslas on the road.

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,200
Business Insider said there would be 10 million.

00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,520
And so far there's 1,400.
