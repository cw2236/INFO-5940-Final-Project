1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,560
My prediction is this time next year, TikTok is a publicly traded company that is

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:09,420
whose majority of governance and asset holders are U.S. based.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:16,280
I do believe that the CCP is going to decide that they'd rather hold on to $300 billion

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,520
than lose 300 billion and lose this propaganda.

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,280
They're losing the propaganda weapon that is TikTok.

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,800
I think that's happening based on what I've seen in the hearing so far.

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:34,360
And I think on the eve of the banning or maybe into the first implementation of it,

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,320
they decided they'd come to some sort of agreement to spend the asset.
